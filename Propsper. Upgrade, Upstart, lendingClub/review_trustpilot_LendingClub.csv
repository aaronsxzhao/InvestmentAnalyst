2023-02-21,"I was never informed about the $300 processing fee. One of my credit cards still has a balance because of the $300 experience. Had I known about it, I would have changed the amount of the loan. Very disappointing experience.",2,LendingClub

2023-02-20,"I signed up for Experian credit reviews and I regularly get emails updating me on my FICO score.  I recently received an email stating I could apply for a loan to consolidate credit cards or a personal loan.  I initially scoffed at the idea thinking they would not give me a loan but then I thought my credit rating was good so why not try.  I was directed to Lending Club and the online application process was so easy I was very surprised.  It literally took 5 to 10 minutes, and they gave me an approval, after two days of review my loan was funded directly to my bank.  I was ecstatic at the ease of the transaction, and I never had to speak with a representative asking a lot of unnecessary questions.  I would recommend Lending Club to anyone needing financial assistance as this was the easiest loan experience I have ever had.",5,LendingClub

2023-02-18,Found Lending Club through Credit Karma and I'm very pleased with my experience so far. It was quick and easy to apply and my loan was funded fast. You save a bit if they pay the credit cards directly. Repaying debt isn't fun but I'm thankful for this loan to do it in half the time with half the interest.,5,LendingClub

2023-02-24,"I was very pleased to get this loan, such fast service! And approval!But I noticed one of my credit cards was not paid. The other 2 had already posted a few days earlier. When I called LendingClub to find out what happened. The customer service representative told me it went to an entirely different company. He said they would not process the payment,it was still pending at the other company. He said they would release the monies when returned by the wrong company. Then they will automatically deposit it into my checking account. I can pay the bill myself. I have a copy of the list I gave to pay off in an email! I don’t understand how they got this confused. I really hope the rest of the money is released soon. And they get it together from now on. Disappointed ☹️",2,LendingClub

2023-02-24,"Process was easy, and straight forward. I was happy about this fact. But the actual funding following the approval was extremely SLOW. I think it was at least two weeks. So slow that as I was refinancing credit card debt, and I had anticipated an approximate ten days in advance of payments due. I missed the target date by over a week. Consequently, I was required to pay more interest on that balance. The very purpose for applying for this loan. This cost I had not anticipated and the additional interest increased my expense for this transaction. I would have been better served to get the loan from my credit union or local bank.",2,LendingClub

2023-02-17,"The first day I applied for the loan was on 02/01/2023 and I waited and kept checking online but didn't see anything updated so after a week I dedicated to call and speak with customer service and was told I was approved the next day but had to wait because account was going into funding, and it can take up to 5-7 business days, so I was happy that I was approved and now I just have to wait.  Well finally the funding went through on 02/13/2023, and I did request for the money to be paid to the creditors I had put on the application, so far only two of the creditors have been paid so far I am still waiting for the last creditor to be paid, but all in all the transition was great overall, easy to apply, customer service is great, and it took nine work days for everything to be completed.I am happy with my decision to go with Lending Club and I am happy that they gave me the opportunity to consolidate my bills into one and to go with a company who has a great reputation, so thanks again Lending Club for helping consumers like me get a better chance in life and a piece of mind knowing all will be great.I am a happy customer and will let family and friends know of my experience with Lending Club.THANK YOU!!!!!!!",5,LendingClub

2023-02-06,"I applied for a loan and was approved. The first time I logged into my dashboard I had an offer for an additional amount already approved to do more credit card consolidation for $19,000. I started the application and after entering the first creditor I received a call and had to stop. When I went to continue, the application had locked up and would not let me add any more creditors. I called, multiple times, trying to get somebody to help me fix it but nobody seemed to know what to do to help. All I needed was the application unlock or them to add the other creditors I wanted to include. After speaking with 3-4 different employees, I was told I could just withdraw my application, which I did. Not even 20 minutes later the same offer appeared again on my dashboard but it would not load anymore. I called again to see if they could help, and of course they said no. So basically, they give you an offer but then don't follow through. Nobody in their staff knows how to correct anything. Oh also, I was told the creditors from my original loan would be paid no later than 7 business days, well here we are 7 business days later and now they are telling me it would take up to 2 weeks. Again, lack of knowledge at best. As soon as I can refinance and move my loan elsewhere i will be leaving and never coming back.",1,LendingClub

2023-02-06,"If you’re having a hard time obtaining a loan, Lending Club is for you. Not saying you will definitely get approved, but they seem to be a little lenient with their qualifications. Just know THERE ARE HIDDEN FEES. I didn’t get the full loan because they took a “fee.” And they’re making me pay back the full loan that included this charge that was taken out. I’m paying back more than I originally planned. But this is what happens when you  have nowhere else to go. Obviously, if you have very good credit and verifiae proof of income, you should go to a more reputable company that could give you a better loan offer.",3,LendingClub

2023-02-01,"I had applied to Lending Club to go after and to secure a loan from them because I have gotten loans in the past from them, and I knew that I would be able to get a loan from them. The only thing that was bad for me was the APR! Ouch that I had to pay. It was for what I requested a CASH out type of deal. I was APPROVED in 48 hours just like they said and then the money was deposited directly into my Bank Account like they said. My STRESS was then very much relieved and I got to reduce the debt where I wanted for it to be reduced. My SS monthly distribution is taking care of the monthly payment for me so I don't have to worry. Just enjoy life! So, I'm Thankful for Lending Club. I will be a customer for ever. They will work with you if you run into any financial issues, such as skipping a month if you need to. I won't be doing that this time. So, I would recommend Lending Club to anyone.",5,LendingClub

2023-01-16,"I have had several loans with LC and never had any issues.  This last time, they did not communicate like they usually do. They had me resubmit proof forms that were on the acceptable list.  I called to explain to them my issue and they noted my account but kept sending the same request.  Then it gets approved and into funding but no one let me know. I usually get an email, but not this time. So I call to see what's why I can't see the deposit.  So now the process is to wait until they verify my other account and then deposit it then. It has been over 3 weeks now, when it would usually take a week.I'm not sure what changed or who may have effected this outcome, but this was one of the worst loan experiences I have had. Communication would have saved this from happening and really prevented me from writing a review. I don't usually write these.  Management needs to streamline the process and those who verify address and living condition, update your list so the customer is not resubmitting the same docs you won't accept that are on the list...very frustrating.  LC can do better, like they used to.",1,LendingClub

When I call about these issues I'm given an empty apology for the inconvenience but that's it.

I called them to set up a wire transfer several days in advance and asked for it to be sent on January 2nd. When the transfer didn't happen, I found out the bank was closed that day! Why would they schedule a wire transfer for a day when they're closed? Today, I've called 5 times and was continually assured it would be done today, but the cutoff time came and it still wasn't done! Now, I'm told it may not be done for 2-3 days!

I thought that applying for the loan would have no impact on my credit score, but days after securing funds, I got an email saying you pulled a hard inquiry on my credit.

2022-12-01,November the 30th got planned for a long for credit card debt and it literally took y'all 9 to 10 days to decide whether or not you going to give me the loan.  I would check periodically to see where it stood to have been no change to my application for the loan.  So I decided to go with somebody else as I figured I wouldn't get one through you.  I got along to upgrade and within 24 hours I had the money in my checking account now they all came and waited almost two weeks to get me money that I've already went somewhere else and gotten and used so now I have two loans to pay back and can't afford them If you're going to take 2 weeks to let somebody know if they got the loan or not The least you could do is keep them updated that you're still investigating or looking over the application and now I'm stuck and don't know what to do cuz I came to pay for y'all's loan. Just goes to show you somebody wants to give you a loan they'll give it to you you ain't got to wait two weeks won't be doing business with y'all ever again,1,LendingClub

My funds were n my account within 2 days. 3 days after my approval I rcvd another offer without needing to run my credit for additional funds to pay off credit card balances with an interest rate of 5%‼️🎉I’d recommend this to anyone especially if you need to consolidate high interest loans.

2022-12-01,"Absolutely trash. Horrible communication. Impossible to speak to someone during the application process. I was denied for one loan so I tried another. It said something like “we will get back to you,” as I attempted to speak to someone. The email response said the same thing so I asked if the new request was being processed or if it was the same thing. NO RESPONSE FOR TWO WEEKS. By then I’d found a more responsive company (Happy Money). They found and funded the full loan through a credit union. A week after that I got an email from lending club for approval of the partial loan I asked questions about with no answers being funded. They gave me a hard time canceling and I’m still dealing with it. No customer service until you’re strapped with a loan. Zero help through the application process. Don’t do it.",1,LendingClub

I needed $40k to pay for a new car.  I started the process of withdrawing funds at $10k a time after 4 pm on November 10.  I was then allowed, on their website, to extract $10k on November 11, 12 and 13. The next day I got an email to say that the first transfer had failed.  They ALL failed because November 11 was a holiday and 12 and 13 were a Saturday and Sunday.  I assumed, since the system had allowed me to make those transactions that all $40 would appear in my checking account in November 15.",2,LendingClub

2022-10-18,"LendingClub is an absolute JOKE, a horrible excuse for a company. This company took an application and approved it on 9/18/22, they claim they tried to deposit the loan funds into my bank account the following day, every 2 business days for the next 17 days we received an email stating they couldnt locate our deposit account and asked for a phone call or they needed to verify the auto payment details, we called, verified that the info needed (which was correct every time) then they said they’d try again, over and over….after the third failed attempt (of the 2 step process), I finally changed the deposit account, it took 4 more days and the funds finally deposited on 10/6. They left the due date as the 19th, even though our funds didnt get deposited until the 6th of the following month. On the 14th, 8 days after funding and 5 days before the due date I called and requested a due date change. I was told that day that she couldnt make the change herself because the first payment hadn’t processed and stated their system should have automatically changed the due date to the 5th of the following month, which is 30 days after funding, she didnt know why it hadnt changed that date and told me she would forward it to a manager to get it corrected. I called today (the due date/my first payment) to verify that the change had in fact occurred. I spoke with a CSR who says, I see the notes on your call from last week, it looks like a manager reviewed it and then closed it because the last CSR you spoke with didnt actually request a change she only entered notes! (WHAT!!) and we processed your payment today. (This is where you should be told that they managed to process the payment FROM the same account that they couldn't figure out how to DEPOSIT FUNDS INTO.) I then proceeded to tell her, well there isnt enough funds in that account, because your company took 18 days to fund the loan, the increased direct deposit didnt take effect until the loan was funded. I asked to speak to a manager, she put me on hold, for a while, like long while, came back twice and told me it was long wait times and did I still want to hold….YES! I want to hold for goodness sake! After probably 20 mins she sent an email instead, got a reply back immediately from a manager that says, my phone doesnt work you need to take a message and I will call her back. So she took a message, when I asked how long until I should expect a reply she told me 24-48 hours….Boy, THAT makes me feel important! I told I would be calling back in 4 hours, well I called back in 6, went through all the same BS that I had been through twice already and got ANOTHER CSR, who finally after going through the story again sent me to a manager, who then argued with me on what an origination date was….its the day we attempted our first deposit, NNNOOO its the day you ACTUALLY made the deposit….then tells me I dont qualify for a date change, but they can change the due date to within 15 days of the current due date, which is the 4th of the following month, ok, fine the 4th is great, ok we will change it to the 4th of November (today is the due date 10/19) but they already took todays payment….I said no, it needs to be from the NEXT due date, (11/19) that means 12/4….he actually said to me well if you do that then you are missing a payment….is this for real? I cant with this!! I hope this is enough that you understand the level (or lack thereof) intelligence you are dealing with with this company. Needless to say, I will be attempting to obtain another loan to make this one go away and do better reviews research next time….good luck if you work with them…lol",1,LendingClub
2022-10-13,"This was the most unbelievably pleasant and easy personal loan I ever did.  It literally took a few days from application to direct deposit into my account.  I was utterly surprised but elated to see this large sum of money in my account.  I had to open and closed my eyes twice in case I was experiencing blurred vision.  I immediately went a head and put a spreadsheet together with all my credit cards then proceeded to pay them off.  I now breath a sigh of relief knowing I will only have one monthly payment of approximately $700, instead of paying several different creditors a total of $1900 per month.  I will now have more residual income and will be able to save substantially more.  Yeahhhh!!!",5,LendingClub

2022-10-05,"I was skeptical about debt consolidation loans. That was before speaking to the the great people at Lending Club. They where so helpful in explaining the process and custom tailoring a loan to fit my needs at a truly great rate and affordable monthly payment. The process was fast, efficient and truly stress free. I have already recommended Lending Club to friends of mine in the same position. Purchased a new home and ran up rather sizable credit card debt trying to get the house completed and livable.

2022-09-30,This is my second time going through lending club. I took my first loan out about 5 years ago and paid it off within the end of my term of 36 months. I appreciate this company for giving me another chance to take out a loan again from them. This time it was something I really needed as an extra back up fund for my business. It gives me enough time to hold the cash in my account not having to stress and worry about having to return borrowed money from friends since they have a short time limit for me. Customer service is always great. They had always made sure I have all my questions answered and helped walked me through what was needed to be done. Highly recommend if you have nowhere else to run to for back up money or any help with covering debt expenses or business expenses for future forecast. Thanks again! And definitely will come back to you guys if ever I needed help like this once this loan is paid off.,5,LendingClub

2022-10-12,"If you have great credit and never have any questions or issues with your loan once you receive it, LendingClub is fine. If you do ever need additional help, information or explanation, prepare yourself to be frustrated and unsatisfied. Customer service here is horrible. The customer service reps are polite but they can not solve problems. My loan is on autopay and this past month I had some extra expenses that cause my bank account to have insufficient funds on my payment date. I got paid two days after the date so I went to my account online and submitted a payment. Once logged in, my account page stated the obvious that my account was past due and I needed to submit a payment. There was nothing stating the autopay would try again to withdraw funds, which it ended up doing two days AFTER I submitted the other payment. I called in to see if I could do anything and explained I didn’t realize autopay would take money out in this situation-after it had failed and after my monthly payment had been made. I was told a refund request was submitted for the additional payment. I call back in the next day and am informed my request was denied because I authorized the online payment. I explained again how I didn’t know autopay would keep trying even after the monthly payment was satisfied (because why would it?). The answer I received was “Yeah the autopay will keep trying up to 15 days after the due date.” So I tried to say again how I did not realize this, this is twice as much money as I was planning on using for my loan payment this month, can we fix this? Silence followed by inexplicably being put on hold for 10 minutes before I hung up and called back. I went through everything again with the new agent. “Your request was denied because you authorized the additional payment” was the response I received again and around in this circle we went until this agent offered to submit the request again “but the request was already denied so I can’t guarantee it will be approved.” Why even submit it again at all? I pled my case asking why there was zero grace or understanding on LendingClub’s end and I was told the customer service agents don’t make the decision, they only submit the requests to the refund department and customers are not allowed to speak with the refund department. This whole experience has been plain bad and has put me in a very tight spot financially for the rest of the month. I felt an extremely low amount of effort and care for my problem to be resolved.",2,LendingClub

2022-10-02,"This company is nothing but a fraudulent loans company that has scam millions of customers. They told me I can’t get my money until after (10) days which I was like I don’t then so you took over $1,000 from me and I must wait so I called my credit union gave them all my documents they could see where I made all my payments and my account was draft several time by these scammers.  Had a loan back in 2/2019, paid them off this year in January 2022. They went into my account after paying them off and took more money after I paid $863 and they took a payment in the amount of $167.80 I had to report them to BBB and FCC to get my money back. And then after paying all the money own this company put on my credit report Account Closed and it hurt my credit score instead of stating paid in full. This company got sued recently settled in a Class Action Lawsuit and they should be closed down scammer. I got a loan for like $5,000 and the document that they send me say total loan amount $4200 and Origination Fees:  $252.00 and Total amount Paid to you which is me $3,948. But I must pay them $6,029 total payment which is sick they finance charge was $2081 looked in my account they less loan money which they never stated anything. Proof this is in my documents. I had them investigated on there practice and yes they had been sued and truly deserve for they did to customers to be paid back. They hurt your credit at the end once you payoff your loan then they take more money out your account after you paid off your loan in full. They should be prosecuted to the fullest a business with workers scamming customers that need money since COVID never again. Did get my credit score but up was approved for a mortgage I would never use this company again I don’t care what I need I would borrow from my TSP before I borrow from them again. And your personal information is kept on file that was how they kept taking my monthly payment. Login recently and my account still active they have all my personal information so I went to my credit Union they help me get my money back from these scammer and I change all my accounting information. This company should be ashamed of themselves taking advantage of customers. 👎🏾 Owner should be prosecuted to the fullest go out here to scam consumers. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾",1,LendingClub

2022-09-16,Was able to attain the money quickly. I was a little surprised about the money that was extracted for preparing documents it was much higher than what was shown originally.  I was able to change my due date but again after I did that I was told that it could affect the payment of the loan at the end.  This should all be presented at the beginning.,4,LendingClub

2022-09-21,This way by far the easiest loan application experience that I have ever had.  I was approved within 48 hours and the money was in my account within 96 hours of sending my application in.  It has allowed me to consolidate debt into a smaller payment but still make the larger payments in order to pay it off faster and with no early payment penalty.,5,LendingClub
2022-09-13,I stumbled upon Lending Club while reviewing my credit. I applied late Thursday or Friday. By Tuesday the funds were in my account. I was a bit skeptical at first but if you provide your documentation as requested and meet the credit criteria you will be approved. My interest rate is a little higher. I’m okay with that. I’m out of credit card debt and have funds leftover. I can manage the payments and will be done in 36 months with a stronger credit score. This was a simple straightforward loan with no last minute changes. Lending Club is true to their word and I’m extremely satisfied with their service and professionalism. I highly recommend them. Good luck!,5,LendingClub

My money was deposited within 3 business days each loan. No hassles, no worries just pay your monthly payments on time and your borrowing power grows. Very happy customer!",5,LendingClub
2022-09-14,"I applied for this loan to do some debt consolidation at a good rate and to get the last of some credit card debts on a lower interest loan to get it finished off. Well it was a good rate, the application went quick and I was thinking this is easy. Unfortunately, the application process is flawed and the staff is under trained or doesn't care. All the 24 hour processing times are a joke. I submitted a 4506-C form since I'm self employed and they give directions during the application process to submit it by printing it out and filling it out and scanning and uploading. Well after a week of radio silence I find out that a separate company called ""Veri-Tax"" sends an e-form you ""have to use"" and thats the problem. So I have to go into my spam folder and find it and do that and email the company to make sure they got it. Another week passes and I reach out again and find out there is a special code that I have to provide to Veri-Tax to make sure the form comes back to my account which was never said anywhere until I called to complain. Well I finally get that to Veri-Tax myself because Lending Club can't be bothered to. Well that finally gets the loan approved. Now after a week of the loan being ""Approved"" I'm waiting on funding because apparently this company doesn't have the capital to fund loans they approve. So now I'm over 3 weeks in, a week after ""approval"" and no word on if or when I'll get my funding. Not to mention that half the time I've called and tried to get answers along the way agents have no idea about what's going on or just give me information that was later proven inaccurate. Definitely get your loan somewhere else.",1,LendingClub
2022-09-14,Amazing experience!  Was approved within days and credit card bill paid several days later.  Was smooth from applying to payout!,5,LendingClub
2022-09-14,The process was easy to use. I met my goal to save a couple of hundred dollars a month on my charge card bills.

2022-09-13,"Since receiving the load from Lending Club, I have experienced the worse experience of my life from a lending institution.  In June 2022 I received a loan for $25000 to pay for dental implants.  Since then I have repaid $2500.00.  I have never received paperwork regarding the loan or the amount of interest, although when I applied I was told the interest rate would be 5.5%.  Since I have been told the rate is as high as 12.99% and as low as 6.75%.  There has been nothing consistent.  I have also received repeated notices stating that a payment is due and the amount has varied this month from $170.05 to 405.05.  Most recent notice indicated the date to be 9/13/2022, which I received today ((9/13/2022)  If I had 23,833 (that amount stated on the most recent notice I would send a Cashiers check in the morning.  When this started I had a credit rating over 790.  It is now closer to 650, all because of this company.

2022-09-01,"I honestly cannot believe how impressed I am with LendingClub. I received an invitation to apply for a loan. I was already in the process of applying for a loan with Upgrade, but was having difficulty getting it processed as quickly as usual. I decided to give LC a try. I provided the information for the accounts I wanted paid off, gave them my checking account info, answered some questions.....then they gave me $22,000.00. THAT is how easy it's supposed to be. I have been an Upgrade customer for years, but they treated me like I was a stranger. I was a first time customer at LendingClub, and they treated me like I'd been with them for decades. The interest rate is about 55% lower than Upgrade so the payments are obviously MUCH lower. Honestly, this is my new standard for getting an emergency loan (they are still high interest/high risk loans, so they are not traditional in any way, but LC is the most professional and friendly way to get one when needed, by far).",5,LendingClub
2022-09-01,"I was looking to consolidate my bills in one monthly payment with one interest rate so I could pay them off faster. The offer was presented through Credit Karma so I applied. I got the approval within minutes. It gave me choices to have the bills paid directly which I would've preferred however, some of my creditors weren't supported when I put them in manually. That's the ONLY reason why I gave a four star rating. It would've given a lower interest rate. I would absolutely recommend Lending Club to anyone with financial needs.",4,LendingClub

(MY FIRST MISTAKE) I go into my Lending Club account and this is what it reads.YOUR 8/1/22 APPLICATION: ADVERSE ACTION NOTICESee why we couldn’t approve your applicationA series of factors are looked at when your application is reviewed and you are presented with offers. Your adverse action notice helps you understand why your application was not approved.) (SECOND MISTAKE)I called Them said cancel loan I found a lender (8.49 APR) 5 minutes later I get a email ""CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE APPROVED"" called back to cancel loan they said nothing that they can do at that time. THAT WAS BEFORE THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER  MONEY WAS DISBURSED, Then after disbursement called them back they said they can now cancel the loan, But I must get the money back from the creditors and my bank within 30 days or I have to go with there contract.

2022-08-30,"Sure, everyone loves Lending Club but for a business account, we have had the worst experience.  Business accounts require them to operated daily and money is a constant inflow and outflow.  But, if there is a glitch in that process, like your DR card gets swiped or there are fraudulent charges, they will lock your account down without notice for at least five days while they review it and bounce checks and auto-deposits leading to a cascade of problems for any business owner.  Despite there being sufficient funds and direct advice on checks and deposits to clear, they will bounce them.  FACT!!!  Their customer service rates about 50/50 for competence.  And they do not stand by their word.  They have your money and their attitude is 'to bad'.  We will be dissolving our relationship with Lending Club.  A business cannot abide by their poor practices.  We have never experienced this with another bank.  If you do deal with Lending Club, do so at your own peril.",1,LendingClub

My only complaint is that I received an email after everything had been processed saying that although I didn’t get a loan I could apply at “Fiona”. This confused me as well as aggravated slightly.  Otherwise, I would recommend Lending Club very highly.",5,LendingClub

2022-08-29,"I applied for a loan to consolidate a few small bills I had so I could pay them off quickly.  I applied in just 10 minutes on a Saturday. No hassles, no complications, just a few questions to answer and input of my info.  The loan was approved by Sunday at a low interest rate and the input of my loans to pay off was very simple. By Tuesday, the small amount I had left after loan payoffs was in my account and by Wednesday my loans were paid off.  Simplest process I have ever done to secure a loan.  100% satisfied!!!",5,LendingClub
2022-08-29,Nowadays they look at your credit score and the credit score doesn’t reflect that responsible person that you are in many cases. For example I never been late to pay my bills I just been going through some rough times right now and when I really needed the money they looked at my credit cards are maxed out and I just thought I was gonna make the payments or what.

2022-08-11,"I was very pleased with the loan application process and things went smoothly until I received the email that my loan was funded. That was when it went downhill...the initial email said that the requested payments to my three credit cards had been sent and would take a few days to process.  The remaining 8,500 would be deposited to my bank account.  I received the money in my account a couple of days later. I waited another couple of days and started to check my credit card balances.  Then my bank balance went up by about 15,000.  So then I thought that maybe I was supposed to pay the credit cards directly, instead of it being sent from Lending Club - since the whole $24,000 had been deposited to me.  I waited another couple of days and still had the money in my bank account and nothing being paid to the credit cards.  So finally I made a payment to two of the cards because at this point the payments were past the due date.  The day after the payments posted, I received an email at almost 10:00pm that the deposits were made in error and would be corrected.So I spent cash from my bank account that was earmarked to buy hay for our hungry cattle to make credit card payments that have now been sent by Lending Club.  I had very specific things that I needed to do with the $24,000 loan proceeds and, due to the multiple errors on the part of your company, I am unable to retrieve the money I need  now for the hay without using the credit cards again and paying interest on the money twice - first to Lending Club and then to Capital One!  I am devastated by this situation and don't know how to make things work now.  So disappointed with the whole situation.  I cannot recommend Lending Club to anyone I know at this point.",2,LendingClub

2022-08-09,"Opened a savings account with them a week ago for the best rate. Wound up overdrawn with my old bank because they repeated a transfer two more times. The LC agent stated this was a known ""glitch."" Honestly, this has not been worth the stress. As I write this, I do not know if I will be charged and LC will reimburse me or not.  A prior message about deposit hold times on new accounts from two business days ago has yet to receive a reply. Worst experience I have had with a bank in my lifetime. STEER CLEAR!Update, their canned response:Response By Email (08/09/2022 10:29 AM)""... We’re aware of a system error that caused LendingClubBank to debit your external account multiple times.  We’re reviewing our records to determine who was impacted by the error so we can correct the transactions.  Account holders impacted by the system error will be notified soon.""Update: My sending bank processed the extra $2000 transfer but due to Covid, will not enforce the transfer limit on that account. The CSR did advise temporarily lifting my overdraft protection so LC/ Radius Bank cannot take anymore, protecting me from the ""glitch.""Additionally, LC's CSR did not provide useful information yesterday. She reassured me she could see no pending transactions, which may have been true as the damage had already been done. (Did not believe her.)  However, I believe we discussed the total balance and i do not believe the extra $2000 they took was included in the balance.Outcome: I will be tight for money for August but should be able handle my bills. And LC got $2000 more in deposits than I intended. I will never make another deposit with them.Outcome on privacy: a canned response that did not address my request to opt in to the maximum allowed restriction on privacy and marketing. Fortunately, my current state provides some extra protection, and I probably would have let it go if I were not planning to move out of state, next year I hope, depending on the economy and home prices.",1,LendingClub

2022-08-01,"My Journey with Lending Club has just begun, and it was Experian who recommended you to me.  So far, I am so very pleased with the ease in making this loan which was specifically to pay off a credit card that I had been much to generous with and the interest charges were looming very quickly.I was impressed that you trusted me and handled this loan so easily.  I will give you an example of a previous loan i made years ago which was the last time i made a personal loan. "" I have been a customer of Wells Fargo bank forever!  I was actually customer of a local bank who Wells Fargo swallowed in their growth expansion years ago.  They advertised the ease i would get by borrowing from them.  That little personal loan which was for about the same amount as I borrowed from you, except it was to help my daughter with her teeth.  That little loan, took about 3 weeks to complete.  I have never been so exasperated in my life and vowed never to do it again.  That is why this balance had gotten so high.. because I was trying to manage it without going to an outside source and refused to go thru the hoops at Wells Fargo.  Experian suggested I make a loan to take care of this balance, and that is what I did.  I surely appreciate the manner in which you determined my eligibility for your loan and the swift manner in which it was processed.  I am beyond impressed and I will recommend your services to my friends.  Thank you so much for helping me.Bobbie J. Buckner",5,LendingClub

2022-07-14,"The process of getting the loan was very simple & easy. But the monthly payments process could be a little better. I wanted to set up my monthly payment into 2 separate payments as that is easier on the wallet. But the company is unable to do repeating automatic withdrawals if you want to break your monthly payment into 2 separate payments. I was unable to do every other Friday nor could I set up 2 payments for more than 3 months at a time. I would have to call back every 3 months to reset this payment process or I would have to personally make each payment every 2 wks. Autopay is not allowed to be used if you want to do 2 payments p month, only for the 1 monthly payment. I have used other lending companies where I could just have a payment automatically withdrawn every 2 wks from my bank, no problem. The automatic withdrawal process w this company only works if you do the 1 lump payment p month. Would've like to have seen more & better options for the customer to be able to make payments easier.",3,LendingClub

2022-07-12,"You guys did an absolutely great job - no doubts, concerns or tough efforts on my part. I wanted only to lower interest rates on my debts and Lending Club made that not only possible, but financially worthwhile.

2022-07-06,"I opened a savings account as Lending Club was offering a better interest rate than most others. A few days after my account opened, I received an email stating my account was frozen due to suspected fraud. Alarmed, I called as directed on the email and was shocked on how horrible their Customer Service agents are.  No exaggeration, it took the agent over five attempts to find me using my last name and SS# - I spelled it our slowly and phonetically (“A like apple”) and still he got it wrong. Even when he finally found me it was another painful 5-7 minutes as I repeated my zip code and phone number. Eventually he found me and when I told him why I was calling he told me “Well I do not see anything in the notes”. I told him about the email and asked him, “If all is ok, then why am I locked out of my account?”. He had no idea and placed me on a 20+ minute hold. 55 minutes into the call the agent, and whomever he reached out to, had no idea why I received the email and why my account was locked. Frustrated I asked for a manager or other supervisor to speak to, another 15-minute hold just to be told none were available. At this point I hung up.  The next morning, I called again, this agent found my account and was able to find the reason for the account and proceeded to help resolve and unlock my account. I thanked her and asked her to close the account. I explained the call earlier and she reviewed the notes. What she read back was not what happened and worse of all, the agent marked it “resolved”. Because of this incompetence I decided to place my savings with another institution. There is no way I am trusting my savings with LendingClub.",1,LendingClub

2022-06-27,"I have mixed feelings about Lending Club. On the good side, their customer service is  articulate, courteous and efficient. The application process was easy as pie and took less than 15 minutes. As well, income verification was effortless. Because they are able to see the direct income deposits into my bank account, I did not have the hassle, nor time delay of digging up W2 forms and faxing them over to them. My loan was deposited into my bank account only 2 days after I applied. The things that did not quite work my way though, was that even though, my payment record on my credit reports is perfect, they approved a loan for me which was $1,800 less than what I requested, and the APR and Interest Rates were still high, even though they advertise low rates. Now I'm going through a really hard time and mountains of hassle trying to make my new LC payment along with payment for the $1,800 that they refused to cover me for. Now after making 3 consecutive on-time payments, I am suspicious that Lending Club IS NOT correctly reporting my payments to the credit bureaus in a timely manner, which is illegal as per the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Even though taking account for interest, I'm also suspicious that LC is incorrectly reporting a lower percentage AND amount of the loan that I've paid. Another issue is that I pay my bill on the 4th, but they don't report it until the 31st, which creates an unfair lag in the accuracy of my credit reports. I've called them and complained that this problem is in conflict with the ""FAIR"" in ""Fair Credit Reporting Act"", but they don't care. They tell me I have to submit an official report to them in writing AND send them a copy of my credit report, which is really unsafe for the security of my credit information, and I suspect it is illegal because it is the lenders legal responsibility to report correct information to the credit bureaus and the customer should not be reported as guilty and have to prove their innocence. Now, I have the headache of having to draft a complaint to the ""The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau"" for assistance to get proper resolution. This is just another example of why I am so sick of paying all of my credit card payments on time and have a really respectable credit rating, only to have these companies screw up on a regular basis and the consumer has to suffer major headache, waste valuable time and effort in correcting their mistakes. They make me sick!",2,LendingClub

Tried using the snowball effect but the interest rates were making my payments look nonexistent. I needed help and Lending Club was offering a way to catch up so I took it.

2022-06-21,"So this company is definitely a scam. I thought it was legit when I saw it had high reviews here, but oh boy was I wrong. I applied for one amount, but when the approval went through, they had jacked up the loan amount. Greater than what it was paying for. This should have made me run away, but I was dumb.The next issue I had was that there is no modern way to pay for your bill. You choose check or you have to link your bank account (which requires you to agree to AutoPay just to net the few suckers). I don't own checks. Most people under 50 do not own checks anymore. Checks have been in decline for the past 20 years. I tried to link a bank account, but then they are asking for my SSN. So that my info can be verified by a 3rd party. First, I know my account info, noone needs to verify it for me to pay from it, I do that all the time on real company websites. Second, I have never, and I do mean never, been asked for my SSN to verify a bank account. It is simply not needed. They are actually asking you to provide all of your account login information and SSN for them to send to a 3rd party ""verification company."" Yeah. Serious sign of fraud. Good luck if you all fall for the 4.8 star rating this con artist bought.",1,LendingClub

In conclusion, it took 3 weeks to do business, it only got kicked into gear when I asked credit Karma to investigate the issue. Then when I recieved the loan it came up shorter than what was requested. I will do my best to never need a personal loan again because this was a terrible experience for me personally. Maybe it was only my case, hopefully others will be different.",2,LendingClub
2022-06-20,"This is the 3rd loan I've had with Lending Club.  They make the process very simple and quick.  Only reason I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is:  After 2 loans with no late payments, no problems whatsoever and having a high credit rating, I thought my interest rate would've been lower.",4,LendingClub
2022-06-20,"Was a very pleasant experience dealing with Lending Club! Everything was handled online, quickly and efficiently!",5,LendingClub
2022-06-18,"LendingClub simply isn't what we thought. It was so infinitely better! We were reticent in applying because we thought we were going to receive callbacks from different companies, and we would have to decide which would give us the best loan. The process was super easy. I was approved (it was done in my name alone) without the usual red tape, the whole thing was paperless, electronic from top to bottom, the cards were paid directly, the ""leftover"" was deposited directly in our account, and here we are on our way to fixing our finances without the horrid unnecessary credit card interests.There was only one thing that I didn't like. I would suggest you be more proactive with communication. A short e-mail every so often saying what you already say on the website (We're working on your approval or something like that) would go a long way. Simply because the paperless/""people-less"" process is so new that people like me, accustomed to and expecting red tape, don't know what to do with their hands. :) Other than that, 'y'all' are perfect!!!Thank you LendingClub. You rocked our world!!!Jofre & Leia",5,LendingClub

2022-06-14,"my suggestion the loan is fine but I want to be honest it takes a long time to give the approval decision also it is not right that they take money from the money they give you from the loan I made a loan of 7200 dollars and from that they took $400 dollars so it is not a loan How do they help? If you have to pay for what they take away from you, I don't see it well. I've eaten loans at other institutions and they give me the full money. Yes, I'm grateful because I needed the money, but you should take these suggestions into account. Bad experience i this is my second loan",3,LendingClub

This company will screw up your information and loan and then expect you to keep calling them to get it resolved. When you do call, your hung up on or placed on hold for extended periods of time.  They won't return calls or follow up with calls; their only phone call is when you don't make your payment.  Would not recommend this lender to my worst enemy.

The experts tell me I needed a better mix than just credit cards, so I'm using this personal loan to add to the mix. The process was quick and easy with a good rate. Best part is no penalties for early pay off. Could have easily been 5 stars, but I don't believe in anything perfect.",4,LendingClub

2022-05-26,While the application process is fairly quick - Once my loan is paid off I will not be using them in the future- nor will I be recommending them to anyone else to use. 1) the rates are too high and 2) their payment process and options are not customer friendly/focused.  The system is geared to forcing customers to set up autopay.  If you do not choose autopay the website will only accept a past due payment - meaning you cannot make an online payment on time using your checking account. The company has intentionally set it up where the payment options are minimal for customer to have control of payment options-forces customer to pay past due or set up autopay.,2,LendingClub
2022-05-26,Loan process was quick and easy. Thank you for your professionalism and knowledge to lending funds.,5,LendingClub
2022-05-25,The loan process was easy but I wasn't happy when I only received 4888 dollars instead of the 5200 dollars that I asked for and are being charged for. To me thats a bit of a scam. So I won't be recommending anyone of my friends or family get a loan from you folks !!,3,LendingClub
2022-05-25,"Took out a second personal loan and was curious if this would be considered a separate loan from the initial first one.

2022-05-25,"Ive been a member for several years--service has been good. However, not so this time around.I applied for a loan. Completed all required tasks, and verified it on their application website. I waited checked back to the site, that said ""application complete"". They never asked for any more information, simply said we're working on it.Then I get a denial letter stating that my application was incomplete.I called and got the run around. They said they called one time and didn't get an answer so they denied the loan. Keep on mind that the website which I checked the day before the denial said everything was good, we're working on it.There was no reason for the denial. Credit score good, never missed a payment, always on time. But their customer service department was too lazy to call again, or simply ask for more info on the website.I was told that the decision was irreversible and that I could start over in 30 days.I then asked to speak with a supervisor. I was put on hold for a while, then told I would be called back in 24 to 72 hours. Great service...I will take my business elsewhere. I already knew that I could beat their interest rate but wanted to be loyal. That ship has sailed...They do not appreciate your business, they take you for granted. No Thanks.",1,LendingClub

When I was not able to pay all of them off I was forced to file bankruptcy.. It caused my credit cards to have high interest rates and my payments were going mostly to the interest pay off....

2022-05-17,"I ended up closing the account after six months because I had a check that was over the daily limit of $25K. Typically, you can deposit large checks at branch, but since Lending Club has no physically branches, I asked 3 times for a limit increase. They kept saying ""yes, just wait 24 hours"" then nothing would happen. After 3 weeks of that back and forth, I closed my account and went to a different bank. The online dashboard also has lags and you have to refresh several times to get an up to date view. There are several other interface issues that made the user experience subpar. For a digital bank that is unacceptable. It was easy to open a business account and a chat representative is always available to answer questions, that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 0.",2,LendingClub

2022-05-05,I got this offer through credit Karma. It sounded too good to be true. Had it came through email I would assume it was a scam. It was so fast simple easy. I used my phone from my living room and in 10 minutes had it done. I applied on a Wednesday and on Friday I had my funds in my bank account. This is how lending and banking and financial institutions should be. THANK YOU!!!,5,LendingClub
2022-05-05,I applied for a third loan with Lending Club after receiving an invitation. The process was extremely easy even though it took a couple weeks to get final approval and receive the money. I think they were extremely busy at the time and had nothing to do with my paperwork. I have received two other loans from them that were completed in 2 to 5 days from start to finish. I'm really happy with my experience with them and will continue to do business with them.,5,LendingClub

2022-05-02,"I personally will never use lendingclub again for two reasons. First, I had an existing loan and got an email about another loan offer and that it would not affect my credit unless I decided to go thru with the loan. Just to see what the rate would be, I went ahead, but I did not take the loan. But they did do a hard credit check and it cause my score to drop. Second, I had payment that did not go through and received an email about it and to resolve it. So I went to the site, made the payment. A few days later, they processed the payment again so two payments were posted to my account. I sent an email to support, they said they saw the two payments and would refund the second within 5 business days. Five business days came and went, had to call them and was informed that the manager declined the refund and it would be for next months payment. I feel like that is a pretty crappy way to do someone after you have told them it was being processed and did not contact them back to let them know that it was declined later.",1,LendingClub
2022-05-02,Thanks for the quick response to my request.,5,LendingClub
2022-05-02,"The debt consolidation process was simple and went smoothly. I'm now paying about $300 less per month than I was with all of my credit cards combined.

2022-04-28,"I already have a loan with Lending Club, the process wasn't as smooth as it was the first time I applied, my only complaint was I had uploaded requested documents, sent them and was asked to send them more that 3 times without a clear explanation as to why, it was very frustrating. It was only when I called several times and spoke with reps that it was explained that documents were not uploading because they weren't in jpeg form and some of the documents had been cut off, additional documents had also been requested in order to make a situation that I had clearer for the person reviewing the loan request.Overall this lasted quite longer than I thought it would. The representatives that I spoke with in customer service were very instrumental in reporting  my issues to the loan department finding out the reasons and relaying the explanation to me, once it was relayed to me I was able to send the loan department what was needed for them to make a determination.",4,LendingClub
2022-04-28,"I found Lending Club through Credit Karma. Lending Club had the best available interest rates for the amount I wanted to borrow to consolidate my debt.

Since I am making payments for more than my payment amount I am calling in each month. I noticed I made a payment and they reverse a payment for the same amount a month later. When I called in they said it was for a check the bank showed stop payment on but a check was never written for the amount. They can't answer why this occurred even though my due dates show current. Wished I had gone with another company.,1,LendingClub

I should have known like all financial intitutions, in spite of all the friendlyness they want your money. I will be paying off my 21% loan when I refiance my house at a much better rate.

2022-04-05,"The loan process WAS fairly easy and completed quickly: However lending Club submitted Two (2) hard Checks for the same personal loan , both posted on the same day, and the Two(2) hard checks for the same single personal loan was reported to the Credit Bureau as shown on my Credit Karma Acct. This resulted in an 11 point drop in my credit score, and have since found out Hard Credit checks stay on your report for Two years. I don't believe that Two hard credit checks for the same personal loan IS LEGAL, and I have filed a formal Protest and Dispute for this action, In addition, Credit Karma states that applying for loans on their platform that you have already been Pre-Approved for, and applying on the Credit Karma site States that""You will not be Hit with a Hard Credit check, and Applying through the Credit Karma site would not result in Again, a Hard Credit check, Nor would it affect your Credit score....So to me this is Fraud and false advertising. Since I am in the process of trying to obtain a refinance on my home this has now caused an issue, Beware of Lies, false and fraudulent statements with Credit Karma and lending Club, when doing business with these Company's, and applying for loans through the Credit Karma Website.

Even though a year ago, my credit score was in the 800 range and there was minimal credit card debt, I found myself now with a lower credit score due to an environment that required the lending of funds from my various available resources. This was for a family health and  financial need  creating the need to borrow additional funds in  order to gain better control of the financial debt situation that evolved.Going on line i checked through Lending Club.  The process and the staff at Lending Club have been extremely helpful, professional and understanding.The process was easy. staff was professional and I was able to provide appropriate document to receive the loan.  I understand the terms  and the requested dollars were put into my bank account in a timely manner.

2022-03-24,"I honestly was on the fence about this company at first. I really hadn’t heard much reviews outside of credit Karma and credit sesame, and they were really mixed. So I did all my research and ended up taking a chance, and I am so glad I did. After the many reviews that assisted me in my decision, I would be doing a disservice had I not left a review, especially for those whom are like myself. This company not only assisted in what they promised, but it was also done in a timely manner. I spoke with someone in customer service on Monday and submitted my to do list that same day. Tuesday morning my loan was approved and creditors were being sent my balance transfer. Cash left over was in my account on Friday. This has allowed me to give myself some long awaited breathing room. Everything such as rates and APR’s was exactly what I was approved for. Everything was simple and transparent, the only con was that a few creditors such as Best Buy and a few other of my credit cards were not accepted in the balance transfer, however I had enough debt to meet the requirement of the loan and majority of my major credit cards were accepted. Overall, I have no complaints, and will definitely be doing business with them again!",5,LendingClub

Meanwhile I am paying interest.on 2-loans and will be required to pay both loans on April9th. This is unacceptable.

I accepted a 12,500 loan to pay off credit card debt after starting a new job and taking a major pay cut. Desperate times desperate measures! I looked at my documents yesterday as I had decided to pay off the remaining balance. I had 3 payments left of 464.69$ or I could pay in full a total of 640.48$! For obvious reasons, I paid this loan off! Not only were they charging me a 19.99% interest rate.. they also charge a 24.57 annual percentage rate.. that's right, folks, a total of 44.56% interest! I did the math.. off of a $12,500.00 loan they charged me a total of 6,000$ in interest!!! Please avoid at all cost!!! This company will put you further in debt! Go to your bank for a loan!

2022-02-20,"Sure the process is straightforward and the company is legitimate as opposed to companies like Balboa Capital.Unfortunately, Lending Club makes it very, very hard to pay off your loan early. For example, there is no way to add more money to your monthly payment.  In addition, during COVID their attempts to offer any deferment was very POOR.  Companies in general were not supposed to make it harder to pay off your loan, or make your total repayment harder.  Lending Club did both. I only got 1 month deferment and have to pay 6 months extra payments.  UNBELIEVABLE!",1,LendingClub

I was thinking it was a error but if you read the loan terms it say they will take a fee out and how much of your loan you will receive. Upon reading that i have a high APR. Reading the Loan agreement it say i will pay 5,724 on a 4,000 dollar loan for 36 months that’s insane. I only applied because i really needed it for car repairs and also do it to boost my credit score which is good but i want to be very good.

Thank you and I will recommend you to all my friends.",5,LendingClub
2022-01-27,I had credit card payments I wanted to pay off… it was taking me a while to pay them off in a timely manner. That’s when I reached out to LendingClub. That was the best decision I ever made. LendingClub understood my concern and helped me conquer my problem. I now have two loans with LendingClub and they’re both up-to-date (no late payments). Thanx LendingClub for being there for me in my time of need. 👌🏾,5,LendingClub
2022-01-26,"I've read lots of good things online about LendingClub's personal checking accounts, which don't charge ATM fees and will even reimburse fees charged by ATMs worldwide. I travel a lot and would like to avoid ATM fees whenever possible, so needless to say, I was really excited to become a member!At the time of applying, I had an 813 credit score. The application process was simple and straightforward. I gave them every bit of information they needed. Surprisingly, my application was denied.I reached out to customer service to try and find out why I was denied and what I could do to sort out any potential issues they had with my application.I was told that my application was denied because LendingClub couldn't verify my identity. I told them I'd love to help them verify my identity in any way possible to become a member. They told me to wait 48 hours for an email with more information as to why my account was denied. That email never came.So, I reached back out to LendingClub two more times in an attempt to verify my identity, but I was shut down each time and was told by the customer service agent that they were unable to verify my identity and there was nothing that could be done to open an account.I could verify my identity in several different ways if LendingClub cared enough to take me seriously. I have a valid drivers license, passport, utility bills, social security card, birth certificate, etc.It seems like LendingClub simply can't be bothered to connect with me to sort out a cut-and-dry issue that could be resolved in a matter of minutes. I guess they don't really value anyone who is not yet a member.The staggering numbers of 5-star reviews on this site are baffling to me, as I was given the run around by multiple customer service agents who would rather give me cookie cutter answers than try to help me get a simple issue sorted out.What a bummer. I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.",1,LendingClub

I had concerns about being approved even though I was pre-approved through Credit Karma. I had been pre-approved with my bank to refinance my mortgage, but there were way too many hoops to jump through.This was straight-forward, everything was spelled out BEFORE I submitted anything. I called customer service to make sure everything was completed correctly and they walked me through my application and said everything looked great.I started the process on Wednesday, January 19 at 7:58am and was approved by Wednesday, January 19 1:07pm!!!!Thank you!!",5,LendingClub

2021-12-30,"I have just started with lending club so I dont know much about what it is going to be like later, but that seems like the easy part. I signed up through Credit Karma because I was repairing my credit for the last few years and I wanted to up my total credit amount while paying off all my cards and lower percentage used. I finally spent about 2 years paying those off on time or paying more than minimums and getting my credit to a reasonable number to work with after clearing up other problems and debts - about 605. (the student loan pause really helped this)I had some recommendations from Credit Karma to use a few places and I liked the in depth research results I found about Lending Club. I applied through my Credit Karma Link, was approved for the amount I needed, and my money was in my account in about 15 hours. It was fast. My experience was that I never had to send them anything else. Never had to talk to anyone. Never had to even print off a single pay stubb. Can't say how your experience here my differ but I read over the steps on their site, answered the questions honestly, and bam... I was done. 5-8 minute process to apply.So far the experience has been great, and the payments are lower than all my credit card minimums and with a better rate. Look at your APR for the loan offer. this is the total interest rate you'll pay. The payments will be based on this. Also there is an origination fee so keep in mind that if you borrow 5500 for example, you will receive only about 5200 give or take because the origination fee for extending the loan comes out of the total amount before its deposited. The fee is not ideal but reasonably expected and its not a huge amount compared to total loan amount. The site is easy to use - it has each payment date and amount listed easily to keep track of. There is an auto pay/auto withdraw option which will save you a little if you use it. paying off early can possibly result in getting back some of the origination fee but I am not there yet. Overall I highly recommend how easy this is. The info is all provided - you just have to read it. No trickery or hidden stuff that is predatory. It is straight forward, honest, and useful.",5,LendingClub
2021-12-29,The process was so easy. It was straightforward. I had funds in a couple days. The payment plan is convenient and I like that it's setup to my needs. Thank you very much for the help. I would recommend this to anyone.,5,LendingClub
2021-12-29,REALLY easy to secure a loan through LendingClub! Money was in my account 3 days after I initially applied. Application was super quick and painless.,5,LendingClub
2021-12-29,I would just like to think lending club for the opportunity that you had given me. I just got back to work three weeks ago I was out of work for four months I had a total right hip replacement. It seemed like everything was falling apart. My furnace then I had to get oil. I had to replace my refrigerator because they decide not to work. So again I thank you so much for this opportunity and not turning me down. I however did tell some people about you guys so I’m hoping that they will reach out to you as well. Have a happy new year. Harriet green,5,LendingClub

Additionally, I'll be able to pay this loan off much faster.  I'm going to buy some shares of your stock just to show support and solidarity for your company.   Thank you so much for everything.",5,LendingClub
2021-12-20,"I never applied for a loan with Lending Club, never inquired. Literally out of no where $23,500 ends up in my account, $25,472 appears on my credit as a personal loan.  No proof of contract, no terms.  I only know it is a 60 month loan at $631.00 a month due to it now being on my credit.  They obtained my identity and bank routing number/account and I didn't apply to them for anything.  I contacted them many times offering to return the money and was given to their ""fraud"" department. It's been 4 month now and literally nothing. I try to get put through to their fraud department and they want my SSN, which I refuse to give.  They ask for a case number that I was never given. I literally was told to call back another time when asking them how I can give this money back.  I asked for proof of contract, no response. I ask for their routing number so I can have my bank legitimately send back the money so I'm covered, I get laughed at. So, I was given $23,500 in my account....and $25,472 put on my credit and I did absolutely nothing to initiate this debt. BBB also has done nothing.  End result, Lending Club will not respond.  I have $25,472 against my 800 plus credit score.  After doing the math myself because I have no contract with terms or conditions....almost a 30% interest rate?!  I would never agree to that.  No contract, no proof of even applying and their response to the BBB was it takes time to investigate. I refuse to pay any payment, just want to give the money back.",1,LendingClub
2021-12-19,"Everything was straightforward, almost surprisingly so. Funding was quick. My one criticism is the less than obvious method for looking at my account details now that the loan has been funded, specifically, the ability to look at disbursements to creditors.",4,LendingClub

2021-12-17,"I guess I'm thankful for the loan that I received. It was far less than the amount I requested and the APR is extremely high. I have an existing loan which is in good standing, so I contacted Lending Club to request a lower rate, but I was denied. Now I have two high interest loans to repay. Oh well. It's not like I was coerced. I view it as a victimless crime. The End",3,LendingClub

2021-12-10,"Well, I did get a loan. Credit Karma  hyped me up by informing me that I had a High possibility of getting $15G. Your site echoed that thought, so I applied. Within the application process, I was advised to apply for only what I needed, which, of course, makes sense. I applied for $13G. When the loan arrived on my doorstep, it was $6000. Glad to receive the token funds, but not all that I needed. Still stuck with high interest larger debts, so essentially still paying the same in interest, only now, 1/2 of it goes to Lending Club. And so, the game continues!!In all fairness though, it does help a little bit.Thank you, A.R.",3,LendingClub

If my credit is good enough for that rate with my car why is it over triple that with a cash loan? This will be my final loan with them unless they'd like to offer a lower interest rate which I doubt is going to happen. To compete with my bank, they can undercut the finance rate but to give me a loan they jack the rate up. Dis honest. Almost predatory loan practice.",1,LendingClub

The one thing, I give them poor rating for is the high interest. Even though the money comes in handy, it still makes it difficult to stay ahead with such high rates. But if like me, you plan to pay it all back before the required time, without penalty, then it is a good deal.",5,LendingClub

The only thing that would have made is better on my interest, is by finding my lenders I could have used Lending Club to pay off direct, but since I was unable to find the majority of them listed, I had to accept a higher interest rate due to accepting the total amount in my account rather than paying off the lenders via Lending Club.",4,LendingClub

2021-10-05,"This loan is expensive, but necessary for my piece of mind.  No other lender will loan $20K unsecured to a run of the mill widow who wants to fix a few things in her 100 year old house. The process took a week after application, and the money was in my bank. LC did not ask questions, I was free to do with the money what I wanted. This is my second loan with them.  The first was to redo a kitchen and bath. No one else would lend me what I needed.  My credit is decent, but to secure a home equity loan is jumping through hoops with tons of paperwork. While they do charge fees for granting the loan, and high interest, they are easy to deal with.  Online communication has improved over the last 3 years, best way to ask questions. I will probably do this one more time.",4,LendingClub

2021-09-23,Horrible service. Declined my business checking account application three times. No reason giving. I've been in business for 15 years using brick and mortar banks. These jokers LendingClub give out PPP loans to virtually anyone and many of those loans went in default. Some because of pandemic. Some because of fraud (Google it). Yet they won't allow me to bank with them. And too afraid to tell me why. In hindsight it's a blessing I was declined. I can already tell the service is poor. Went to with Chase and got approved right away for my growing business. LendingClub is great for scammers and deadbeats. Bad for real business owners.,1,LendingClub

Text STOP to stop texts.”When I looked up online, it said it wouldn’t be taken out till October 16th.I tried calling the 888 phone number on a recorded line. I asked her: why did I get this text message? Is money going to be coming out of my account this week or is it going to be on October 16th?She couldn’t give me a straight answer. I asked for her name, she said it was Andrew. I asked for her employee ID number, just in case money would be taken out of my account this week since I do not have the money on hand and if it was taken out, I would have to borrow money or else I would be penalized. I do not want to be penalized. She told me she did not know her employee ID number since she was new.She also told me she wasn’t sure why I got that text. I asked to speak to a manager but it took too long and I hung up.

2021-08-30,"'ve two loans with Lending Club. The 1st was started a little less than a year ago. Moved most of my 24% to 26% interest credit card balances over to Lending Club at 11% plus the origination fee bumping it to 14% or 15%. My 2nd Lending Club loan was very recent. I moved the remainder of all my credit card balances to it. However, this 2nd loan added with the origination fee ended up at 22.5% interest??? Still less than the credit cards were charging. But disappointing that Lending Club's loan calculators had decided I was leveraged out enough to justify a higher interest rate that was not much lower than the credit cards I was trying to escape from. All that with a higher credit score and longer established payment record than at the time of the 1st Lending Club loan. Which was a way lower interest rate. Live and learn. I'm still glad to get away from the credit card interest rates I was paying. But the ending was kind of a bitter sweet compromise considering my higher than average credit score. Credit scores can only do so much when you have limited disposable income I guess. Again, live and learn.",3,LendingClub

BEWARE:  when you need to defer, they do not give you the option to stop auto pay, this company is NOT for the people, they don't listen, all they care about is MONEY, NOT CUSTOMERS.  To be clear, I pay $480 for a 62 month term, I only have 22 more payments left and never asked for help (other than COVID) but I've proven myself that I am fully capable of making these payments monthly, but the one time I needed to explore my options they weren't trying to hear it.",1,LendingClub

Lending Club switched the accounts and paid the small one with the larger check and paid the large one with the smaller check resulting in one account still open and a large refund due to me so they tell me!  I saw this coming before it happened and knew they would owe me money.  So I called and asked the question in the event of an overpayment what is the procedure to receive my refund and how long does it take?  I was told that it is a quick process like 3 days and that I did not need to do anything unless I had not received monies within 10 days.  So now we are at 2 weeks and I am told monies will not even begin to be released back until after 10 working days  8/20 and I may receive monies by Sept 1, 2021.

I was very satisfied with the whole process. I gladly give Lending club 5 Stars.",5,LendingClub
2021-08-16,"Lending Club usually does a great job, however, with this new consolidation loan in order to get the lower rate, the borrower puts in the accounts for them to be paid directly from the funds borrowed. Which would be great if they were paid in a timely manner. One account was paid past the date of the pay out, two other accounts still remain unpaid. Which, will leave me with a balance that I will have to pay. Quite disappointed in this process.",3,LendingClub

2021-08-16,"The loan process was as easy as can be.  There is one thing I'd like to bring up.  When I submitted my request for this loan it was mean to payoff the two loans I had with Lending Club.  I had assumed this would be deducted from the total amount borrowed but I had to submit it manually which cost me about 30 dollars more than it would have been if it would have paid off on the day the loan cleared.  I didn't know this had not occurred until I opened by bank account to see what amount had been received.  Other than that, no other issues.",5,LendingClub

I have an excellent credit score, rates are historically low, and I have 36/36 on time payments on a previously paid off loan with lending club, and my rate on this loan was reasonably higher than my previous loan. I guess it’s better than 22+% I was paying on my credit card, but was hoping for a bit better rate after numerous emails claiming I had a “special offer” waiting with lending club",2,LendingClub

2021-08-09,"I misunderstood how the money was going to be dispersed. I told them I wanted to combine debt so I was asked for account numbers, which I gave.I wasn't sure how much they were lending me so when the money was deposited into my account, very quickly, I thought that my other accounts were paid off.

I was approved thanks to my excellent payment history and good credit. I was able to pay off every one of my 10 credit cards except for one, which just has a small balance that I can easily pay off in short time. It's such a relief to get all those bills paid off and funneled into just one payment that is reasonable. Three of my credit cards are going to be canceled once they are all rectified.",5,LendingClub

2021-08-04,"While actually and finally receiving the loan...this was a hellish process. It took about 2 weeks of sending in qualified documents proving my address, and continually told they are somehow not correct (they all were - including the address NOT being a P.O. box like one of the emails stated). Meanwhile, all I received were blanket statement emails and no help until I called after 2 weeks. For some reason, I had to tell someone to Google the address and then all the sudden they could figure out how to use all 5 differing address verification documents I uploaded. I received actual funds to bank within reasonable time but time taken for funds to pay bill accounts (credit cards, etc) took way longer than it would have if I had done it myself once receiving all the money directly to my bank. This is working so far, but customer service seems almost nonexistent and there is a general incompetence in the process.",2,LendingClub

I called back the next day and talked to Angela, She told me I had to pay Mar, April, & May 6 weeks, that I would not be considered late. I told her that was a rip-off, because I called in on the 14th as usual. I did as asked then they reported me late at the bureas, and I have never been late. They are liars.",1,LendingClub

However some bills might not get paid for 4 to 5 days. They are accruing interest as well. So you are accruing interest on the same debt twice at the same time. Again, that might be minor, but it seams a bit odd to me.",4,LendingClub

2021-07-23,Lord in Heaven. What ah Life Saver Lending Club is ! The interest rate for a loan is smart and fair. A Client is able to get a lower interest rate than the credit cards in many instances. People do find themselves cornered on the life continuum. For example your wife is receiving cancer surgery. She almost passed away in the ICU. Lending Club came thru like Champions for me. i was able to shift Lending Club financing into liquid to pay balances off on some really horrendous hardship maniacal cruel high interest box store lending institution loans.  The loan approval was almost instant from Lending Club. The cash floated into the bank account within 24 hours. i was able to slay debts that were killing my Family. Lending Club trusted me and saved us thousands upon thousands on serious killer debts. Lending Club is fair to borrowers. Lending Club supports Equal Opportunity lending and they are outstanding. They lend you money so you can slay debt. it is like getting a second chance at financial life. Give Lending Club a try. Borrow at the low interest rate and pay off high interest debt to give yourselves a breather. i am so excited to pay off more debt. Lending Club is the ticket to a better financial life. When you finally get your financial house in order; You will be blessed with beautiful top tier top of line line lowest interest rates as your asset to debt ratio will be sparkling. You are entrusted to honor all debts. Life is better at the top of the rarefied fiscal responsibly of life. i love it when you pay off a Lending Club loan; They show a pop surprise congratulations party icon. So encouraging you want to come back because you are no longer behind the eight ball; You can slay debt like a Dragon Slayer. All Thanks to The Lending Club.,5,LendingClub

2021-07-23,The process was easy and it allowed me to refinance all my credit card debt to a much more manageable lower interest rate loan.

2021-07-21,"I was being solicited by emails to take out a personal loan to reduce my credit card balances. I did have a couple of zero interest cards that were about to start charging me interest in a couple of months. I started an application with a different company but I didn't like some of the requirements (W2s & 1040!) so I never finished the app. It wasn't that important anyway. A loan would help but isn't necessary. Then I got a solicitation from Lending Club. I've seen some articles on this organization in some investment newsletters I read, so I knew they were legit. It was very easy to apply and I was approved almost instantly. I specified three credit cards that I wanted to pay off, with the account numbers and amounts. Within two business days, the difference between the loan amount and the amount paid to the three credit cards was deposited into my checking account as agreed. I was blown away. By the third business day all credit cards were paid off as I requested. I am extremely satisfied with the experience. The interest rate will save me money, and I intend to repay early anyway. I swear I am not related to anyone who works at Lending Club, I am just very happy with their service.",5,LendingClub

2021-07-16,"My experience with LendingClub was as follows: My initial contact via online was simple at first; however, when I had to upload documents the process became cumbersome. The communication was not there. I had to research a phone number in order to speak to a live person. I had to go through 3 representatives in order to resolve my issue. If I had not been persistent on my end I don’t think I would have been funded when I was. It appears though noted in the system, no one could rectify the problem. It was until I spoke with I believe her name was Chastity and she thoroughly explained what was going on.  All they needed was an explanation of the document (paystubs) because they were unable to read on of them, a simple fix has I known. I had to upload the documents about 6 times before I was told what the issue was. Once i resent the documents directly to her the process was funded with no issue. Overall, funding process was excellent it this online system that need more work. We should be able to speak to a representative at anytime.

2021-07-13,Received a loan from Lending Club and the process was quick I had the funds within a day or two without any hassle the online process is very user friendly,5,LendingClub
2021-07-13,"The only reason I'm giving this four stars and not five is the insistence on automatic loan payments. Yes, LendingClub offers some flexibility in terms of resetting payment dates. But for some like me, it's just not practical to not have control over when in the month you can make your payment. Aside from that, the process to qualify for the loan and get funds to other creditors in a balance transfer loan is simple, streamlined, and user-friendly. LendingClub also overcommunicates, which is a good thing -- you always know what's going on in the process.",4,LendingClub

2021-07-06,"Hello, I have worked with LendingClub in the past and still have an existing loan I am paying off.  In the middle of of June I began applying for a second loan.  This time the process was a hot mess.  I was sent an email that I was not approved for my requested loan.  So I worked with a different lender and received a loan through a different provider.  However, a few days after I received notification from LendingClub of my denial, $15,040 was automatically deposited in my checking account.  I did not approve this loan, I did not sign any loan documents and did not want this loan now that I had secured funding outside of LendingClub.  I immediately called LendingClub customer service where I spoke with an inpolite and curt young woman who claimed I had applied four times in one day for a loan--this is simply not accurate.  Anyway, she agreed to cancel the loan and explained the funds would be removed from my account in 7 - 13 business days.  I did receive an email confirmation of the loan cancellation.  BUT, I then began to receive additional emails telling me that $15,040 would be removed MONTHLY from my account--what the heck!  I called customer service again to confirm that I would only have the $15,040 withdrawn once and to reconfirm my loan was canceled.  But I continue to this day to receive emails addressing services about this loan that I canceled.  After I finish paying off my existing account/loan with LendingClub I most likely will stay away from your company as something is not right....your customer service is rude, your email communications are incorrect and this is a lot of money to incorrectly put in someone's account.",1,LendingClub
2021-07-06,"LENDING CLUB - you came through for me, when I needed you! Lending Club was advertised on Credit Karma as a personal loan company.  Sure enough. After being rejected by my own Federal Credit Service (mind you, I had 2 other personal loans I had with them, & paid it off), Lending Club lent me the money to pay off my credit card.",5,LendingClub
2021-07-06,This was a blessing.  Best advice I can give is make sure you use the funds to pay of the debt instead of spending it on stuff that you don't need. I was able to pay of my credit cards and student loan. Now I only have one payment to make monthly. What am paying now is not even half of my total amount I use to pay monthly. The interest alone was my payment right now. I got a second chance am going to try my best to stay away from credit card moving forward. If I don't have money am not buying. Thank you Lendingclub.,5,LendingClub
2021-07-06,"Right now, I can only give three stars because of the following:The speed at which my loan request was okayed, was great, and you also set my first automatic payment date real fast, but there is one problem, my loan money still has not been deposited to my account, which means if it hasn't posted by the time my first payment is due, I am going to be in one heck of a mess for the month because I won't have enough money for groceries or to pay the bill for which I took out the loan.",3,LendingClub

2021-06-15,"Lending club approved my loan request in 5 minutes and funded my loan in 48 hrs! It is the fastest process I’ve ever seen. I love the option they have to send payments directly to creditors. I used this option to pay all of my credit cards to under a 30% balance and they put the rest in my bank account. Which was a Godsend as our water pump went out in our car the day my loan funded! For those of you wondering or thinking I borrowed a couple thousand I’d like to tell you it was not. I borrowed 13k, I had $9300 go directly to my credit card accounts and the rest(- the processing fee) into my bank account. Yes the interest is a little high but I was given the option of cutting the terms from 60 months to 36 for a small payment difference. Which would have also lowered the interest about 10% but I chose the longer terms just incase Covid rears it’s ugly head again and we end up closing down again. I can always many extra principal payments as well as send more then the minimum payment to reduce the interest. So that is what abs why I chose the latter. Again I’ve never seen a faster loan approval process and my credit is a solid FAIR. Paying down my credit cards will move me into the GOOD rating. Which as everyone knows is harder to obtain since the changed the scoring. But at the time of my loan I had several cards over the 30% balance I strive for which lowered my score( thank you Covid) so at the time lending club ran my credit using credit karma( soft credit pull) my score was 632. So to be approved so fast and for 13k which is what I asked for I thought was just awesome. I am thinking about getting a second one when I’m eligible to replace my roof and gutters in my house. One more thing, their payment and loan tracking online is super user friendly. I really really appreciate how easy it is to use and check payment history or dates etc. I highly recommend Lending Club especially in times like these. I can’t tell you how much better I’m sleeping knowing I’ve rolled everything into one payment and the payment is $500 less than what I was paying out every month. Thank You LC, you guys Rock!",5,LendingClub

2021-05-14,"I was a little apprehensive in applying for a personal consolidation loan, because I have been rejected quite a few times because of credit issues.

2021-05-12,"We jumped into Lending Club as a way to potentially reduce credit card interest/payments. We were quickly pre-approved. Because we are not traditionally employed, the process from then on took quite sometime (several weeks). My biggest complaint: lack of communication (things not accepted with absolutely no explanation, just would have it deleted and then a message to submit) and an overall lack of information when we called in (we would be told the delay was one thing, would address, then find out that wasn't it). This was frustrating enough that we nearly withdrew our application. Positive: Everyone we spoke to was above-and-beyond friendly and tried to assist. We were super impressed with every single person we talked with. No wait times for talking. Very impressive. Bottom-Line: We got approved, everything was applied quickly, we are happy overall. Will recommend (with a few concerns) to others.",4,LendingClub

There is a way to withdraw all of your money but you have to pay a fee.2) They a 1% fee for the profits you earn.3) The returns are not all that great. Yes I am sure there is a chance you could invest in some risky notes and get a big return but I just don't think its worth it.

2020-11-20,"I have used LendingClub about three times now. They have helped us when we were in a pinch and needed extra cash to fix a car or help with high-interest rate cards. They have always been great to work with and fast, I never want to use a bank for a loan again.",5,LendingClub
2020-10-22,"This loan is a straight rip off!!! They lock you into a high interest rate and no matter how much your credit score has improved you cannot refinance your loan. I have had payments where more interest was taken out then the previous months even though this is a simple interest loan that should be having more principle applied to the loan as you pay it off. They pretended to offer ""help"" for those having trouble making payments when Corona first hit the economy. Because I needed this assistance for two months, not only did they take 100% interest from my next 3 payments (two of which was over the minimal amount due per month) after the deferment period ended, they also charged compound interest from the total amount of the initial loan as if I hadn't paid interest for the payments I had made towards the loan already! So they got interest on top of interest as the ""help"" they pretended to be providing. Because I needed those two months help I was rewarded with paying $1200 over the last 4 months with not even $20 being applied towards my principle! This loan was one of the absolute worse decisions I've made this year. They will be lucky if they get one more dime out of me! I have paid well over $2000 towards my loan and not even $600 has come off of it! This is a predatory loan and I caution anyone to deal with this company. This is nothing short of highway robbery and I will do my very best letting anyone who cares to listen to go elsewhere for a loan. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!",1,LendingClub

The letter of paIf off was not even available after three weeks.  Other than that never had issues.  Customer service was good but can tell how they are restricted to make decisions.  No their fault just too management to move things faster for better service.  If I satisfied your debt (well paid interest you guys cashed) I shouldn’t be calling you several times to request a letter or process with the credit bureaus.  Unacceptable. Had.

As of today I still haven't received by money.  They keep saying it takes time.  Really???? it should not take this long to receive your money back.  When you email them for anything it takes 2 days for them to respond that is if they even respond.

2020-09-05,"Lending Club is HORRIBLE. At the beginning of 2020 I stopped allowing them automatic withdrawals from my bank. I called them and made a deal to pay things off on my fourth loan with them. I'd never had a problem. I was told it was all set up and the new withdrawals would be made and I gave them permission. It's been a dog's breakfast ever since. They have satellite operators who usually don't know what the hell anyone else has done. In the last loan I have with them, I have set things up FIVE TIMES with different operators and been told everything is good. But for a couple of months I thought things were being taken out and forget about it. They didnt. I called to find out what was going on and they said, oh, you were sent to collections. So I got that straightened out and paid. I wrote the CEO about it - NO REPLY, NOTHING. I called August 2020 and an operator in Houston told me it's all straightened out now. But guess what? IT WASN'T. I got a letter today 9/3/20 saying, oh, you didn't make your payment. STAY VERY FAR AWAY FROM LENDING CLUB, they're horrible.",1,LendingClub
2020-08-28,"I was approved for a loan last year of $5k. I filed bk in 2018 so I was happy to get a lender who would take a chance. After a year of on time payments I received an invite first a second loan. It just so happens that I am moving and going on maternity leave so I needed the money to bridge the gap. I apply and I get crickets. They sent me the invite and then nothing. My application online says my to-do list is complete, yet, it’s been pending review with no update for days. I don’t understand. Calling in is of little help. One person said it can take up to 45 days and that the issue is finding an investor to back the loan. Are you kidding me? Why tell me I’m approved, pull my credit, and not have funds to send?! This is crazy! It’s probably a sign from God to not take on the debt! I’m not struggling financially. It just would have helped to have the extra cushion. My first loan was approved & funded in days, but that was before Covid. I am going to probably end up taking the sign from God and canceling the app. I have enough anxiety on my plate!",2,LendingClub

We've never missed a payment and I thought it would be a simple phone call to defer one payment until we go back to work.

When I asked to speak with supervisor she had me wait on hold for 5 minutes then answered herself, claiming that we only 'potentially' had the virus, although my husband actually tested positive a few days ago. Then i spoke with the the supervisor, who showed all kinds of sympathy, but then offeredmea 2month deferment with a $1000 interest charge! I asked to speak to her manager and he had zero sympathy and spoke like a robot, repeating the same thing. I actually liked this place in the beginning, but now that I see how they're treating people who are putting their lives on the line to be at work. Im shocked and feel degraded by this. Im also gonna be contacting an attorney to ensure that these people are within the bounds of the law because it is no one's fault if you take the precautions and you still get the virus.

2020-04-21,"I've been investing with Lending Club for about eight years. My experience and rate of return have significantly declined because Lending Club too aggressively prioritized expanding its loan pool. Inevitably, what happened was a surge of trash loans and scams - perplexingly high number of defaults on loans that Lending Club graded highly. Recovery fees that are charged by Lending Club regularly exceed the amount collected on past-due notes, which creates the bizarre outcome of the lender being additionally charged for defaulted notes. Lending Club is solely focused on profits, which they make by issuing as many loans as possible, they do not care about the quality of return for investors or the people to which they are issuing loans. This creates a dangerous situation for investors since Lending Club has very little risk exposure in the loans that they issue as all of the money comes from investors on the platform. Increasingly, I consider Lending Club more like a Ponzi scheme than a valid investment option. I am gradually withdrawing funds and closing my account because Lending Club's practices are shady and unscrupulous.",1,LendingClub

And I got a great rate.After you complete your initial application and are approved, the money is in your account with 48 hours. And the smart thing to do is to just let them withdraw the payment from your checking account each month so there is no guess work.And if you want to change the day you make your payment. It's not a problem. I cannot say enough good things about Lending Club. And their customer service is among the best around.If you need a loan...This is the place to get it.",5,LendingClub

You can't get them on the phone, I've already waited over an hour and their excuse time and time again is it is very busy.  They have already stated rates will not change in any way due to the Corona Virus.  They make it almost impossible to make a payment.  You can't do it online.  You can't do it early, and if you have to make a payment late, there is a steep penalty.  Stay away!!",1,LendingClub

2020-03-20,"APPROACH LENDING CLUB WITH CAUTION!  Just terrible Customer Service...It's amazing how the entire approach to good customer service and kind attention that was originally provided during the course of my monthly payments being made on a personal loan with Lending Club, suddenly changed once that loan was paid off!Once last four of your SSN is entered on the call in to Customer Service, it seems a crazy long hold time is in place to get to a Customer Service rep on the line (NEVER experienced a long hold time prior to loan pay off). For example on March 19th, I had called in to their Customer Service to question why when I was seeing my loan paid off online, funds were still being withdrawn the month after pay off confirmation? I do not exaggerate in the least when I'm telling you I waited 45 minutes to get a rep on the phone and after listening to my billing concern, I was then asked to be placed on hold. While on hold, the Customer Service rep LEFT THE CALL and I DID NOT HANG UP for more than 3 hours! That's no joke - MORE THAN 3 HOURS ON HOLD! This could have gone on all night until the rep came in the next morning to see her call button was still lit up.THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED AND I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH LENDING CLUB AGAIN!",2,LendingClub

I had been on a new job for less than three months. Even though my credit card debt was high, my credit scores reflected a perfect record of making payments on time and current increases in available credit on my credit cards. LendingClub took a chance on me. The process was quick and simple. I decided which credit cards got paid, and what amounts would be paid to each card. In addition, I received the amount left to reach my full loan  amount in a direct deposit into my bank account. The interest on this loan is substantially less than the interest on the credit cards I was able to pay off. I am now in a much better place financially. In just three years, I will be debt free!!",5,LendingClub

Three fourths of the loan will be used for state and federal income taxes for 2019. I will only need it this year as I am allowing STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM of OHIO to take a monthly amount from my pension to give me sufficient funds for IRS and STATE OF OHIO taxes in the next year.  The only negative thing that I will say is that THE SIGN IN is NOT USER FRIENDLY. THE POSITIVES OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVE. I am happy to know that my repayment amount is AUTOMATICALLY deducted from my checking account. I am happy to know as well that I will be able to pay off the loan faster by paying an additional amount in some months.and that it is easy to do. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RECOMMEND LENDING CLUB TO A FRIEND.",4,LendingClub
2020-02-23,I appreciate the easy process to be able to consolidate some debt and get it paid off at a lower interest rate and a fixed schedule.  I recommend Lending Club!,5,LendingClub
2020-02-22,"Pretty fast to get a loan and the terms are clearly defined as all other documents they send you through email. Deposited the cash fast and it has a clear schedule that one adheres to or you can pay ahead and get out of your loan sooner. The only con I would see is that you're not able to pay earlier per month (to count towards that month's payment rather than just the principle) compared to a traditional bank loan but if it's any consolation, it's motivation for you to stay on track and keep a certain amount of money every single month.Given the short-term and high interest I have, I feel confident that I'll be able to knock it out earlier than scheduled. Which is a good thing because it beats payiy a lot of more interest to credit cards that I used this service to consolidate. I definitely recommend them, especially if you don't have many other options.",5,LendingClub
2020-02-22,The easiest and smoothest lending experience. Period.,5,LendingClub

2020-02-21,"I disagree with LendingClub l apply for second loan for $10,000 and LendingClub sent me several emails denying the loan and the suggested me to go to another lender.  So l apply to another lender that approved me.  For $15,000 with lower interés days after LendingClub approved the loan for $10,000 and deposit the money in my account  and l had not realized the deposit until 2/19/20 and it is supposed to be deposited on 2/13/20 and l called on 2/19/20 to denying the loan but customer service told me it had already been 6 days LendingClub collected the money from my account that l request but that mistake or misunderstood cost me in 6 days pay to LendingClub $910.70 it doesn’t seem fair",1,LendingClub
2020-02-20,I've been using Lending Club for almost two years to help consolidate bills and streamline payments.  I just processed my second loan and it was just as easy as the first time.  Rates are comparable or better than the banks. Ease of the process is the best part!,5,LendingClub

2020-02-20,"I LOVE Lending Club.  This is the 5th time I have used them.  Each time I get a low interest loan I use to pay off high interest credit.  Over the years they have saved me Hundreds and Hundreds of Dollars.  They are professional, low interest, fast and save me money.  What more can you ask for from a loan company?  I strongly recommend them to anyone paying high interest rates on credit,",5,LendingClub
2020-02-20,"LendingClub was the only organization which trusted me and supported my financial goal of consolidating my debt. I have a good credit score and despite that, other loaners denied me.

But I found a better deal.You would have gotten more stars, but the company I went with, was also quoted by you AT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE APR/INT. Dealing directly with the company got me a lower rate.So thanks, but no thanks.",3,LendingClub
2020-02-19,I have found lending club to be very responsive to my financial needs. Loans from lending club have allowed me to plan out my financial goals - have some significant dental work done - and do it with a fixed payment and upfront interest costs- so that I know how much it is going to cost me in the end.  Their application is quick and easy and all of the requirements are upfront. I appreciate no prepayment penalty - and no application fees. This is going to allow me to become debt free in just a few months instead of years.,5,LendingClub

2020-02-14,"I have gotten two loans with lending club within two years, it all went smooth. I’m not sure if it’s because my credit is good and my loans aren’t huge amounts but so far I received what I asked for. My payments are also automatically for a year now. I’ve never had issues with them. Payments are fixed and low in my opinion and easy to manage. I do dislike the constant mails received or emails about new offers. But I think every company does that. They have online accounts where you can simply see how your payments are going. Customer service has also been great the 3 times I’ve been on the phone.",5,LendingClub

The process couldn't have been easier, funds were in my checking account within 3 days and 6 payments to credit cards were complete within 4 days. The interest rate of 6.5 % was also extremely reasonable with a low initiation fee of $140.00. Now I am watching my FICO score soar, hopefully to @ 800 by next month.  Thank you LendingClub!",5,LendingClub

2020-02-11,"My Husband and I have over $20,000  in credit card debit. Our credit is good and we made more than our minimum payments each month. However, we both thought that we had to do something, but didn't know what, but knew we had to get these credit cards paid off so that we had 1 monthly payment and 1 interest charge vs all the different interest charges that are applied each month on each of our charge credits, we felt we were on a hamster wheel. I was getting flyers in the mail from all kinds of different companies that offered loans to pay off your credit card debit. I called a few of them but felt that it was not a good fit for us, then I received a flyer from Lending Club.  I called Lending Club and the customer service representative I spoke with was so knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything to me because this was a big decision that we were going to make and I wanted to make sure this would be a good fit. I felt like family and not just another loan number or account number. So, my husband and I spoke about it and felt that Lending Club would work for us. It also wouldn't effect our credit score because it was a soft pull just to check what our interest rate would be for the amount we were asking to barrow. We applied online as a joint applicant on a Wednesday and we were approved the following day on Thursday.  They said that the funds would be in our account within 4-7 days depending on your bank, however the funds were in our account that Friday. So it took 3 days total.   I couldn't believe how easy it was to obtain a loan and the interest rate is really good compared to each one of our accounts. We were also able to choose if you want to pay off your loan in 36 month or 60 months and you are even able to pick the payment date each month.  I am extremely happy with the choice we made and the level of customer service we received anytime we called to ask questions. I would definitely recommend you reaching out to Lending Club, the phone call doesn't cost you a dime...",5,LendingClub

Very clean and easy to understand. Took off one star simply because it was not made clear until the loan was already funded and finalized that the payments are automatic payments only. Haven’t had any need to speak to their customer service yet so I can’t speak to that. Everything seems grand though. Good rate and all.

2020-01-18,Magnificent people do magnificent things.  The Lending Club is a step in trust.  There must be trust in the lender that the funds will be recovered and trust from the borrower when it comes to divulging private information that can be compromised. When you have much of nothing to began with; Trust in the hope that things will work out for the better with just a little help from a friend.   Someone you may not know that is trusting a loan may uplift a Spirit is playing it forward for the Lending Club.   Keep hope alive...,5,LendingClub

When presented the option to go the cash route so I'd some money in my pocket I balked because the whole object was to reduce interest rates and lower monthly payments. In hindsight I should have gone the cash route for a variety of reasons but this was still a great experience.,5,LendingClub

Others we looked at were daily or weekly and had ridiculous interest rate.,5,LendingClub
2020-01-15,"So far, so good. The process was quick and the interest rate for the personal loan is so much better than any of the other financial institutions I had gone to. This loan beats out any of the competitors I was checking out. I got a response from a Lending Club and a few other financial institutions within a day in which the process began. The payback time was what I wanted and there are no penalties for paying the loan off earlier. My credit score, which is very good  was taken in to more serious consideraton than the other banking institutions. I am grateful for this experience. It was better than what I had with major institutions in which I had a relationship with.",5,LendingClub

The process was so incredibly easy, and every person I have connected with at the company has been so helpful and so understanding. In the past, when I've gone through the process with other companies, I've always been confused and honestly, felt a little helpless. LendingClub was the first company that truly saw me as an individual and not just a debt holder. Their finance tools are so helpful, and really, my future is most definitely brighter because of them.",5,LendingClub

2020-01-07,"Lending club exceeded my expectations. Credit Karma suggested a CC consolidation so I pressed the button to apply for $24k with LC. It was an Immediate approval & responded that I could actually borrow $38,000 at the same rate. The offer was 36 or 48 month, whichever I preferred at a rate 50% less than my lowest CC rate. There was a loan origination fee of $1900 (for 36 months, more for 48) plus I would be paying interest so I thought about it a bit then hit yes! The funds were in my checking account in 2 business days. No paperwork, no phone calls....nothing. Lending Club didn't tell me what to do with the funds, but what this loan helped me achieve is remarkable. I payed off CC's (goodby utilization rate!) then applied funds to my car loan and another loan I have at Discover. The origination fee paid for itself with this move. I am saving $4000 on interest and accelerated payoff's on each of those loan to match this loans payoff. I am keeping a few dollars in the bank so I don't use credit and will apply more to my other loans as I feel is comfortable month over month. Thank you Lending Club for the easy application, the counter-offer, the term choices, the good rate, fast funding and constant contact every step of the way.

2020-01-01,"My belief that I was improving my credit and building a good credit history has been proven to me by the acceptance of Lending Club to my inquiry about obtaining a personal loan.  I have been told to improve my credit I needed to show in many different ways that I could handle all types of credit situations, retail accounts, car loan, checking accts., etc.  But no one would give me a substantial loan until Christmas Eve when I was approved and given a loan to pay down some of my bills.  It certainly made my Holiday a Happy one!  And it was easy!  The staff is friendly, the application was approved quickly and they explain the process completely.

2019-11-06,"I started a Debt Consolidation application with Lending Club(LC) on 08/28/19 about 10:30pm. I was unable to complete the application.  I needed the account numbers of the credit cards I wanted to pay down or pay off.  The application was very easy to follow.  The estimated Truth in Lending Disclosure indicated a  payment I could afford and an interest rate  less than 1/3 of my lowest current interest rate.  I thought, this is to good to be true!  Why are they messing with me? Just deny me as fast as the other two lenders did, one of which I completed a 3 year timely payment loan just last year.  I felt I was wasting my time, but I didn’t want to cause any problems with the application process.  The following morning I called LC.  I explained that I wouldn’t be able to complete the application until I return home on 09/4/19.  Most credit cards websites show only the last four digits of your account number.  The full account number cannot be given to you over the phone, nor via emails or texts. The LC representative was very polite.  She documented my application with our conversation.  She even read the statement back to me.  Even though I felt I had no chance of getting this loan, she in no way made me feel that way.  I said to myself, she is really good.  She further explained that LC would continue to send me emails regarding the completion of my application but not to be alarmed. She was correct.  I received an email  around 8am the same morning requesting additional info...” Okay, here we go” is what I said.  I sent LC an email explaining my situation.  At 11:24AM, I received another email, “We’ve notated your account.  Be advised that until we receive this information, we may continue to contact you regarding your account”.  LC sent additional contact emails each morning on 8/30, 8/31, 9/2, 9/3, 9/4.  My plane was delayed on 9/4 so I didn’t get home until after midnight.  I completed the application on 9/5 about 1AM.  I received an email from LC at 1:23AM, thanking me for completing my To-Do List with the accounts I wanted to be paid off.  This included the following statement “Below are the accounts that will be paid down for you.”  I said, “yeah, yeah, yeah.”  On 9/6/19 at 2:07 PM, another LC email, but what a shock!!! “Congratulations!  Your loan is approved  and backed by investors...” I cried... Thank you LC, I can now sleep at night.",5,LendingClub

When my husband left me with lots of Bill's and no money I was sure that I'd never be on top of my game again. I had ""good"" credit but everything I'd ever been given credit for was in my husband's name! Even though I worked that was just how it was. With Lending Club I was given that chance again.

Well... to say this guy was rude and woyldnt let me talk because everytime I tried to he kept talking over me and just kept repeating that I hadn't been approved and I hadn't got the loan yet. I tried to tell him it was approved but he just kept talking over me extremely rude and condescending until I finally had to ask for a supervisor who was extremely nice and very helpful and we got everything completed.

2019-10-23,"I am on my third loan with Lending Club, and I have to say, they have the best rates, the best service, and the best people. Once you join the Lending Club, you are a part of the family.  They take good care of you as long as you show good faith in your commitment to use the money to help show your creditworthiness and have a decent score and pay your bills on time, then what more can you ask for.  They are the ones taking a change on you and if you build trust with them, there is never a problem with them being there for you when you need them to be and provide you with the funds to get your through the tough times. Why go anywhere else? Once you are a part of their family, they will look after you like any family would and you can count on them. The way a loan is structured for payback is not like having a loan at all, it is automatically deducted each month and that way keeps you account paid without you even thinking about it. I just consider it like a tax that is deducted from your paycheck and never give it another thought and then one day, you find you have an additional few more dollars in your account because they debt has been paid off. How can it be any simpler.Thanks guys.",5,LendingClub

2019-10-10,"This is the 3rd loan, and smallest, that I have gotten from you. Each time I do business with you it seems you get more and more limited in your ability to meet my needs. The first time I ever borrowed from you it was a $30,000.00 loan. The second time was, if I remember correctly, about $8000.00. Between these two there was a refusal of my credit causing me to have to go elsewhere for the money. This time I only applied for $3000.00 and noticed my approval was only for up to about $4500.00. Also, with my $8000.00 loan it was approved the same day I applied. So when this most recent $3000.00 loan was not finalized within 24 hours I applied at my bank assuming you were going to deny it. I bring all this up because throughout all I just mentioned, NOTHING about me has changed. Not my payment history, not my debt to income ratio, not my credit score. In fact, my income has gone up considerably since the first loan I made with you. And by the way, I had the money in my account after applying with my bank,  before I even got an email from you concerning my application with you. You eventually approved this latest loan but I don't know that I will continue to use you based on my diminishing positive experience each time I do business with you.",3,LendingClub

2019-09-17,"Since LC decided to dis-invest non US residents, they are progressively depleting my account but in the process, which will take over a year and closer to 2 years, they are gouging me of interests: year to date, I am averaging 1.5%!!There is nothing I can do, online access has been disabled and they just charge me recovery fees, service fees, collection fees and, of course, more ""charged off loans"" than interests, resulting in more losses every month: it feels like thorough rip-off.",1,LendingClub

2019-06-26,"Lending club had sent me multiple offers and "" preapprovals"" however they are all a scam. I was sent a pre approval...then denyed multiple times. Not only false hope but false ADVERTISEMENT!!! A waste of time. I wrote the ""management "" never got a response. What a waste of time!!! Clearly they don't want my money!!!",1,LendingClub
2019-06-18,"There are many options out there for someone seeking a personal loan and I highly recommend anyone seeking a loan to find an alternate source.  DO NOT use Lending Club.  Their customer service is horrible.  They made in error in my payment processing which completely threw my finances into chaos.  Despite LC being quick to admit fault they were painfully slow to resolve the issue and simply put, their resolution wasn't much of a resolution.  In speaking with over a dozen different representatives the story being spun by LC kept changing and evolving as to why they would be unable to assist me.  I was bold faced lied to on multiple occasions as the LC rep clearly just wanted to get me off the phone so they told me what I wanted to hear despite it not being truthful; the nasty follow-up call the next day would no doubt be someone else's problem I guess.  I was told three different times I would be contacted by a supervisor and I have still yet to have that phone call.  If you get an offer from LC in the mail do yourself a favor and throw it away immediately.  You will regret your decision if you choose LC and need them to provide any level of basic customer support.  I'd give them 0 stars if it would let me.",1,LendingClub
2019-06-02,"This is my first negative review since 2014 but this company deserves it a couple of months ago I had a plan to go in the vocation I asked for a loan they said unfornatly your not approved.ok it's fine then two days later I got a letter they said your pre-qualified I was just surprised I submit again and they said sorry, unfortunately, your not approved this time I really disappointed I called them and asked please stop sending me these offers anymore  but still they keep sending me every other day when I open my mailbox there is a mail from them so I taught its better to share with you guys and also I have plan to send an email to the board of BBB about this company once again don't trust and don't waste your time",1,LendingClub
2019-05-16,"Horrible waste of time.After reviewing all the documents, they approved me with the $55k business loan. At the final step, Mana (their representative) asked the document that can't be even existed (2017 Business Tax Return). All the documents were clearly stated that the business was founded in 2018) they're unable to move forward with a business loan at this time. This is my second waste of time with them (first time they decline my personal loan). Don't repeat my mistake - this company is a waste of time.",1,LendingClub

2018-12-13,"Today is December 20, 2018 and I am still awaiting confirmation about my loan after responding to a letter of pre-approval from Scott Sanborn last month (November). On November 15, after completing the required task list, I received an email that indicated that payments in specified amounts were on their way to the creditors (3) I listed and that the balance of the loan proceeds would be deposited in my bank account. Despite speaking by phone to about six (6) reps, nothing has happened, as I believed in good faith upon the information provided. Although I completed a survey after my application that was satisfactory in tone, I am disappointed about my experience and I would be hesitant to recommend Lending Club to anyone going forward.",3,LendingClub
2018-12-13,"Lending club has sent me many  emails encouraging me to apply for a loan! They gave me the impression that I am prequalified for a loan of up to $35000! When I called the customer service the guy on the phone Jose reassured  me that I am 100% qualified And that there should be no problem at all with receiving the loan that I need for home-improvement and debt consolidation.  I sent them check stubs and W-2 forms and other requests, and I have a pretty decent score 700 Trans Union. Two days later I received an email saying I don’t qualify for that loan and we’re going to refer you to a high interest bank. So I think that banks like this need to be a little more honest and up front.  Stop Misleading people! And wasting peoples time and energy!",1,LendingClub

2018-08-31,I want to thank Lending Club for pulling through when everyone else wasn't even coming close to what I needed.  I did everything online.  Never spoke to a live person.  Just submitted the documents they requested and magically the money was in my account. The only critique I could give would be for them to be a little more informative about where we are in the process. Honestly I didn't even know I got the loan until I went to the store a couple days later and when I checked my bank balance through the app on my phone....I was suddenly $40k richer than I was the day before.  I thought my bank made a mistake or something.  I had to research who put the money in my account to figure out that it was Lending Club. I guess I just didn't believe it would be that easy.  I was able to pay off all my credit cards and now I only have one monthly payment that is much lower than what I was paying my credit card companies.  Thank you again.,5,LendingClub
