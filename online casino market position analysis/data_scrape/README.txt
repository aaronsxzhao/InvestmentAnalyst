2. pesudo_data.py is for scraping data from website, however, i built this specifically for some yahoo finance. couldnt be universal since each website is built in different way but with minor modification, it can then work. data will be automatically stored in pseudo_data/'company name' and three csv files will be generated, which are income statement, balance sheet and cash flow for further use.
