0,williamhill,***UPDATE*** ABSOLUTE GARBAGE of an app. If they can't get their app functioning correctly how can you trust them to look after your stored financial details ? UNINSTALLING I expected this app to be better than using the website. Wrong !!! The app won't stay logged in. A lot of the promotions aren't available in the app and redirect me to the website 🤔 Watching the live races the picture is jittery and the sound cuts in and out. Not easy to navigate. All-in-all not a great experience.,2022-10-29 09:55:14,1
1,williamhill,"Good overall. Very happy with viewing live racing. Since this review I have experienced problems watching racing TV. The screen either freezes or the connection stops during the race. It really spoils the enjoyment of watching a race. I was advised to turn off the phone and then turn it back on again and reinstall the app which I have done, but the problem is still there. I still love the app but I love to watch a race and I don't know why this problem occurs.",2021-07-18 01:13:31,3
2,williamhill,Recently since you've changed the formatting for the betting slip opening to the bottom right. The betting slip doesn't create a full text box and is cropped. Useless as it's off screen in portrait or landscape. closing app sort sometimes and sometimes not. please put the betting slip to the bottom row or as a separate page again!,2021-04-06 10:56:53,1
3,williamhill,"Unable to open any of the promotions on the home screen. Everything else works ok but not the promotions. You are also not able to navigate to the promotions another way. This is happening to a few people I know. Have tried reinstalling the app, deleting the cache etc. Still not working, been an issue for a few weeks now.",2022-06-28 04:13:52,1
4,williamhill,"Originally the app was all fine yknow, winning little bits here and there and generally behaving like a casino. However, after I had a large win about 4 months ago, I have yet to have a single win that even comes remotely close to anything near that. For example. Today, I played 100+ spins on one of the online machines. Out of these 100+ spins, I won 3 times. Out of those 3 wins, one of them was more than a pound. The site used to be good but honestly, its so suspicious these days,don't do it.",2023-01-25 13:11:40,1
5,williamhill,"Games glitch like crazy played a while now and I am yet to win over £20 on Slots. Slot reels will drop on,then all of a sudden it will drop it out in a flash. Or the reels will spin crazy for AGES and you think something is going to happen and nothing. Also it takes so long to load that i have to close an reopen the app for it to actually display my bets. Not had a great experience myself and I won't be using it anymore.",2023-01-18 17:50:03,2
6,williamhill,"App tabs don't work. Slots don't load. Try and access Scratch Of The Day and it rarely loads. Try and play Golden Blitz slots and it never loads once screen is on option for selecting boost. Free or 4 has the same problem as Scratch Of The Day. It's pretty frustrating. Odds wise, about as good as anybody else",2023-02-10 09:56:45,1
7,williamhill,"NOT HAPPY..I will have to delete this app....... Yesterday I got 5 free spins which I was unable to use as it kept freezing, so I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, now its worst than ever.... Again today i have got 5 free spins on pots of but when when I try to (press screen and swipe up it does nothing,, really disappointing. I will wait for a new update and maybe try again.",2023-01-26 18:40:14,1
8,williamhill,"Very disappointed in your app,I do forecast doubles through the card at each meeting,lately it only allowing me to put certain number of races,ie, 14 race card= 28 greyhounds, its getting to 18 then resset to 0 so have to re-do then it's the same,so I give up on that,I keep trying it works OK after certain times,if I do my forecast the night before it's perfect,please get your tech team to sort this glitch out.",2023-01-27 08:02:17,4
9,williamhill,Awful website and app 'freezes' when you have a winning bet you wish to cash out. Promotions can't be claimed. Logs you out randomly. Unable to add enhanced promotions to betslip (asks me to log in when already logged in). Closing my account and deleting the app as its total trash. Just use Skybet,2023-01-27 10:28:04,1
10,williamhill,"Not a very reliable app at all. Very slow to respond so missed out on bets. Promotional offers dont always work, even tried to reload 3 times but fave up on the supposedly FREE spins. Gonna take my money and run to one of their competitors, they certainly cant be as bad.",2023-01-18 17:51:54,3
11,williamhill,"Constant issues with the app not knowing whether you're logged in or not. You log in and can navigate through your account details and bet history, but at the same time trying to place a bet tells you to login. The scratch of the day link on the homepage doesn't take you anywhere half the time and that's probably because it thinks you're not logged in also. I missed out on a free bet too as the claim button didn't work for the same issue. Would uninstall if not for the epic odds on Saturday.",2022-10-21 11:17:47,1
12,williamhill,Probably the best betting app I've used for offers and price boosts. The reason for 3 stars is that the Scratyof the day function only opens about 25% of the time from both the main screen and the menu. Please fix this as it's one of the best features on the app.,2022-12-17 07:21:13,3
13,williamhill,"App freezes constantly, consistently get account ID error that will not show balance or allow to place bets. Uninstalled/reinstalled multiple times with no joy and no response from customer support. In general the layout is easy to use and i like the funtionality but the glitches are making it pretty much unuseable",2022-12-23 07:18:48,2
14,williamhill,"I enjoy the app. Only frustration is Scratch Of The Day. It's not available until you select a sport, then the bet button at the bottom of the page goes live and you can select Scratch Of The Day. All in all, great offers and odds. Happy with the app in general.",2022-12-26 17:51:34,4
15,williamhill,"constant bugs, i click on something and its just doesnt work. especially with the bonuses. its like on purpose. ridiciolous. starlight fruits never give you anything like literally NOTHING not even one spin gives you anything, to the point ridiculousness. *update* Still constant bugs not letting me using scratch of the day, and even if i somehow manage to do it it wont let me use the free spins i get.",2022-12-27 14:54:27,2
16,williamhill,Avoid this company! I know one of my bets have come in but I cannot log into my account. I requested a password reset numerous occasions and nothing was sent. I finally received a reset email after four days of trying just to be contacted by the support team to say my account is locked and needs verification. I have sent all requested documents multiple times but get the same automatic response saying they need more info. Basically they will let you deposit money but not withdraw anything.,2022-12-21 05:52:25,1
17,williamhill,"Don't know what's happened to the app or website it won't let me play any games, when asking to tap or swipe up to play doesn't do a thing just gives me a black screen I can't even use the money I have on my account as it won't allow me to do ANYTHING!! Very frustrating, I don't know what's happened but it needs sorting ASAP",2023-01-25 13:21:16,1
18,williamhill,"Great app but now unable to open any slots games. It gets to 'swipe up and tap screen to enter full screen' but on swiping up and tapping, nothing happens. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, but no joy.",2023-01-27 06:32:22,3
19,williamhill,App been OK for a year or so now can't get to play any promotional games as screen freezes just as game is loading. Have complained about it they said would get back to me nobody has got back. Have cleared cache several times don't work. Now have to go in incognito to play them that should not have to happen very disappointed Davie,2023-01-28 15:21:11,3
20,williamhill,"It's ok , but sadly just right now as I experienced, you'll see at times you'd press on your bet and it bets for you a whole game instead of points, and you can cash out already just with a huge minus pfuhhh how is this even possible... Otherwise it's okay but either they simulate your options after a nice row of win or the app basically is a trash but for sure it CAN'T BE accidental because it always happens after a row of your winnings!!! SHAME",2022-10-16 06:36:32,2
21,williamhill,"Woeful navigation, at times you tap something and a different thing comes up, you can tap things and nothing happens. So much more could be done to make this user friendly but not much has changed in a long time. So poor",2022-11-06 03:20:09,1
22,williamhill,"Probably the most frustrating app and betting experience I've encountered. Every other day I'm either logged out, have my account suspended for a random amount of time for no reason, be locked out of the 'my bets' page, have things fail to load, and hang randomly. The promotions are pretty good but the overall experience is horrific. Wouldn't recommend unless you're a patient person.",2022-11-02 13:56:42,1
23,williamhill,I had no problem with the app but since upgrading my tablet to Samsung Galaxy tab s8 plus I do not get my notifications and they are turned on also cannot view in landscape...any suggestions? 08/10/22 I am now receiving my notification alerts on my tablet and my phone...big thanks to your tech guys. Thank you :),2022-10-08 13:17:49,5
24,williamhill,"Used to be great, now everytime I load the app I'm unable to view my placed bets as the tab at the bottom is greyed out. I am also unable to use any promotions at all and the app is just generally very slow and jittery, its a shame really because I find William Hill one of if not the best value bookmakers out there. I've used the live chat and the agent just tells me there's nothing wrong with my account and that they can see my bets...unhelpful.",2022-11-24 03:10:19,1
25,williamhill,"Keeps logging out. Even when logged in if you try to click promotions or look at your bets it says you aren't. They then work and you can see bets if you click home again, seems like the system doesn't actually log in until you click home. Once you are done with promotion and try exit it then opens up my browser and proceeds to open 5 internet pages of the William hill website and hangs the app, if I wanted the web site I would use website, I'm using app for a reason.",2022-12-07 07:25:13,1
26,williamhill,"Cash out options on bets on all the way through and then during your final game the cash out option is withdrawn for no apparent reason. Every outcome favours them not the punter, so basically very limited to any kind of win unless you are spot on!!! Don't even have a contact or even a live chat anymore.",2022-10-16 15:15:04,1
27,williamhill,"The app is so flaky. Sometimes it shows you your open bets and other times it doesn't. They don't even appear under Bets from the main menu. You'd think William Hill would have a killer app, instead the last update was back in September! Time to try another company.",2023-01-15 03:03:41,1
28,williamhill,"No loyalty at all and very poor customer service. I've been blocked on this site from all promotions because I of more than 2 deposits in a day, I presume they won't give me the actual reason why but also I can still deposit (but with no wins at all). No warning or notices about what will happen if you deposit a few times in 1 day and when I go on live chat they just say sorry like it means something. William hill is a joke and just takes you're money and doesn't reward loyalty please avoid!!!",2022-10-10 21:16:32,1
29,williamhill,"Had nothing but trouble with it logging on. Doesn't recognise any of my details. Had to contact the chat service change password several times. And still keeps telling me it doesn't recognise my Username/password , try clicking on forgotten password then it tells me it doesn't recognise my email address. Think I'll be getting what money I have in the account back and closing my WH account down as this is a total waste of time.",2022-12-29 06:11:35,1
30,williamhill,"Very poor recently constantly having problems with betting on promotions but not limited to that and if you try to contact there help team you just get the runaround no accountability for the problems, but it seems to be a problem with most betting app & that's why they don't give a s#@%",2022-11-21 11:45:01,1
31,williamhill,Can't get passed find your location when opening the app even though have location permission enabled!,2023-02-11 04:19:25,1
32,williamhill,Unfortunately the app is not working in the Channel Islands area... something that it is funny as we do have William Hill bet stores here... Any plans to fix this as the app does not even open and gets stuck on the screen that cannot validate location despite location services on my Android phone active for this app??,2022-10-14 19:09:04,1
33,williamhill,"Good app. Downfalls? Place a bet on a horse then you cant watch the race saying you must place a bet, when I have. Adds extra teams to my footy bets. Odds on teams are way off what they should be. And a few times recieved returns less than what I should have got. And the odds on teams are way off what they should be. And after all this time keep editing problems. The horse racing bet, still cant watch racing. Problems not getting sorted",2023-01-26 08:00:10,1
34,williamhill,Wow so has I put money in and play 5 off straight way no win but then you play on and start to win. As soon you get a bonus the reel spinning it slightly freezes as if you suppose to get bonus but it rolls one extra so you lose it. Be careful,2022-12-03 10:37:43,3
35,williamhill,Really disappointed with this app at the moment was great till the other day but now it won't load up games. I get to tap to play n it won't work so you can't play really needs looking into as I've tried everything that the techs told me to do. It's just tis little glitch that's spoiling my game play,2023-01-27 06:04:07,2
36,williamhill,"App doesn't work as it should. Can't check my bets once they're live, which totally defeats the purpose of having online features such as cash out options etc. App seems to work fine when taking my money though. Sort it out",2023-01-14 10:25:54,1
37,williamhill,"New members do not download this app. Im a new member, put money on the account. Played for a few hours then they locked my account. Apparently security reasons. So far 6 days of nothing, no reason, no outcome and no information. All I'm told is to wait.. cant get my money out of the account I have in there. Worst customer service ever, and can not answer simple questions. I'm making complaints to there head office and even then they won't replay. Minus 5* from me. Would not recommend to anyone.",2022-10-06 15:20:17,1
38,williamhill,Very poor experience so far. If you log in it tells you you can't make a bet until the event has passed then it tells you your not logged in and now it tells be the account is locked. No reasonable contact can be made with customer services. I'd uninstall right now but have money sat in the account I cannot withdraw. Try a different app and the free £40 offer is bs also,2022-12-14 16:35:05,1
39,williamhill,"AVOID! - took my deposit, let me place a bet then when trying to withdraw asked for verification. Sent documents, no reply. Messaged them, claimed they never received (despite me sending to the direct link they provided) so sent again - no reply again. Upon trying to message them again couldn't even sign in. SCAMMERS!",2023-02-02 18:40:43,1
40,williamhill,"Garbage, tried to use it several times but it's too glitchy to finish anything started. As others said, can't trust this with account details if it's so obviously faulty.",2023-01-03 11:45:31,1
41,williamhill,"I don't care about losing money, ultimately William Hill only exists because enough people lose money. But the app is just poor. From issues with deposits to issues with withdrawals. Bets not displaying. Bonus drops and games not working properly.",2022-10-27 21:33:09,1
42,williamhill,"Really enjoying my new experience using the app and the different games, It gives so much information regarding betting around the world, loving the World Cup odds, loved the promotion regarding the 40 pounds worth of bets at the World Cup. I will recommend this app to all my friends and family.",2022-11-27 13:00:58,4
43,williamhill,"To be honest it is good and has got alot quicker since they started, I bet alot so I have seen progression within the site and have won a few jackpots , but the free game is rubbish and hasn't ever met expectations waste of time, My account at present is DOWN so only bet if you having a laugh the bonus games a far a few but when they hit BOOM 💥 😅 I won 890 quid on the new genie game it's a top game when the bonus hits and is alot of fun but it's addictive so always be careful and playsafe",2022-11-04 08:40:48,4
44,williamhill,"Having so many issues with the app, links not working, in-play odds often out of date. You might click a 9/4 only to see 1/7 on your betslip. You've got to be careful not to get caught out. Bet365 is so much better",2022-12-09 00:56:02,2
45,williamhill,"I'm now dropping my rating down to 2 stars, the app has got more slow, the promotions don't load, during spins, i get taken back to the home page, with the amount of money william hill make, they should be able to produce a better performing app!",2022-09-16 03:47:13,2
46,williamhill,"Absolutely awful app. Login and it takes ages and ages to load your bets, not good if you're thinking of cashing out. Constant issues when pressing widgets for features.",2022-11-05 09:34:23,1
47,williamhill,"Often, it takes avges for current bets to show up, but as a rule it works, OK. Could do with adding cards and corners to the notifications in Football Matches.",2023-01-01 11:05:33,4
48,williamhill,Unable to log in for past few weeks. Their help was no help at all.uninstalled and reinstalled lots of times but nothing works. Update. Can now log in but account restricted. Don't think they like the 1 star,2022-10-31 03:11:06,1
49,williamhill,Improved a bundle since I last used William hill about 4 years ago. I had given up on William hill but having returned it is now on a par with bet365 and the pair of them way ahead of the rest. Whoever took over and redesigned the app needs a pay rise 😉,2022-10-03 13:19:25,5
50,williamhill,Vegas doesn't work on the app or on the website. Just takes me to a non English version of William Hill instead. Has been going on for over a week. Not been able to play any slots at all.,2023-02-04 10:32:42,1

65,williamhill,"I bet on games as it makes them more interesting, it's not so much about winning or losing as I don't put on massive stakes. It makes me feel more involved in the game. William Hill are happy to take your money when you lose but as soon as you start to win on the promotions they suddenly say you are no longer eligible. The Epic Odds have now been reduced to a pathetic £1.50 William Hill is the betting site equivalent of the sulking kid taking their ball home because they are losing.",2022-11-26 06:00:53,1

85,williamhill,Constantly very slow and difficult to see bets. Half of the time you can't even click to see how bets are going on. This then makes it hard to cash out. The scratch of the day hardly ever loads either,2022-10-29 09:47:51,1
86,williamhill,A little buggy at times but good overall. A little more information on in play player stats would be a welcome addition.,2022-11-05 05:44:39,4
87,williamhill,Great app. Easy to use. Give great odds boosts and promotions. I've been on many other bet apps but this is by far best one out there. Will be staying with William hill for sure.,2022-10-21 09:13:17,5

92,williamhill,I like this App but it needs a bit of upgrading because I've been trying to do the drop and win for the past couple of weeks now and it hasn't been working I have to go on the website and do it very disappointing,2022-10-14 06:31:40,2
93,williamhill,None of the promotion features work consistently. My bets doesn't always show my live bets and I end up logging in through a browser instead.,2022-09-20 16:06:37,2

98,williamhill,"Opened my account, deposited money and then I was asked to provide some pictures and documents to verify my identity and funding source. After I submitted all that they asked for more: letter from inland revenue and utility bills (my address was already verified thru shown in other documents).

118,williamhill,Probably the worst app I have ever encountered in my lifetime...keeps freezing and quality is poor...no good if placing bets..can't give no stars unfortunately,2022-09-24 12:13:11,1
119,williamhill,"App performance can be terrible at times, regularly having to clear the cache or fully re-installing the app to speed things up, sometimes takes over a minute to list all open bets, far too slow for fans of in-play betting - new betslip layout far less satisfying than previous - on the previous version when you'd won a line in an acc it had a simple ""Won"" box beside it, now it's a little green light + no longer receiving notifications of in-play events. betslip's now taking > 3 mins to render",2020-08-29 09:37:58,2

I've uninstalled & reinstalled the app, loggin in & out but still can't make any bets on the bet slip page without the app closing down. I don't want to have too many betting apps on my phone, so if I have to move on to another, I'm guessing I'll have too. I've also reported the feedback twice when the app crashes & informed the company on Twitter",2021-08-17 08:06:38,1

123,williamhill,"Worst Experience I've ever had on a betting app. At £1 per game on the slots, ate through £300 in less than 2 hours with only one bonus round played. No new member good luck here then. Closed account the same night I opened it. Easily heaviest/quickest losing session I've had in 5 years of playing online games. Won't be returning. Only wish I could give zero stars.",2021-04-29 23:24:36,1
124,williamhill,Decent offers and willing to take a decent bet unlike some but the app itself is shocking. If I switch away from the app to look at the form for a football bet or a horse then return to the app the page fully reloads and then any selections I've made vanish and take a while to show again. Which is fine if you've got time but when rushing it's a pain to be honest,2021-05-10 07:20:57,2

126,williamhill,Unable to open while on holiday. Is telling me I am in a country where betting is not allowed. Seriously? In Italy is not allowed? Use the mobile site instead... I can't use it online either as it takes me to williamhill.it and it tells me I have not account obviously with them. The app should keep your settings like if you were at home.,2022-09-11 06:16:23,1

129,williamhill,Be careful with these their casino part never pays out I've been a customer for 8 months now & regular deposit too but I've never once and I mean once hit a bonus. Today was the final straw. Recorded my game play and 30 times 2 bonus symbols come on the board but never a third. I genuinely believe these and bet365 have some control over their games and pay outs. I've played the same games on other sites and win here and there but on William Hill it never ever happens.

130,williamhill,"Mind numbingly slow. You press a button, then years later it actually does something. I also tend to have my football app open at the same time and flick between the two but every time I go back to the WH app, it reloads the whole page and occasionally wipes the acca I was building in the process. Search function is awful too, doesnt bring up matches that are in the daily list. Painfully, painfully bad app compared to literally every single other betting app out there",2020-09-22 07:32:09,1
131,williamhill,The new app is awful. Whenever I change the odds format to decimal all betting screens go blank. I am unable to access my open bets via the open bets tag at the bottom of the page so I cannot see cash in options. I constantly have to delete the app then reinstall to clear its faults and it takes an age to place a bet. The new layout is also a nightmare. After many years I am changing to another on line bookie.,2020-09-05 12:50:38,1

I would use another betting provider. back to sky bet.",2018-12-22 14:07:57,1
133,williamhill,"I have had issues logging in for the last 2 days. I've updated the app, deleted and reinstalled, turned phone on and off numerous times yet still can't get the app to allow me to log in.

Once I can login I will be withdrawing funds and using a different site",2021-04-11 16:45:35,1

So I am on the Settled Bets page, keeping the app open I switch to a notes app to check the bets I am looking for, and every time I then go back to this App it refreshes and gives me the homepage. I have tried clearing the cache and also reinstalling the app - made no difference. Gonna try the website!",2020-09-22 15:02:33,1

137,williamhill,"Everyone said this app was the worst but I had to find out for myself. Well I did find out and it's by far the worst gambling app I've ever seen. Half the games you cant get in to it just says error101 and the ones you do get into the algorithms are set so heavily against you that you have zero chance of winning. Yes its gambling you win some you lose some, I expect to lose. But you'll lose far too often here, have a game of blackjack you'll see. AVOID!",2020-11-16 23:40:58,1

140,williamhill,Still making it hard to use the bonus drop Couldn't get to use it several times now why so many steps for something that's meant to be fun but it does nothing but irritate ultimately leading to leaving without betting. And yes just because I feel you make it hard deliberitly. Like the slogan says when the fun stops....stop!!! in my case leave without a bet.,2020-03-23 19:55:25,2
141,williamhill,Originally gave the app 5 stars until today. Got a bonus on a slot game won 10 free spins then during them spins I won another 10.

I have stopped gambling during midweek football as I can't be bothered with its laggyness. Shame really as everything else is really good and has good offers.

The app feels like a start up betting company with their first ever app. It's very amateur especially from a supposed reputable company. It is painfulky slow with the interface (I have a note 10 plus, so it's not my phone). Constantly have to relogin... After 3 attempt usually. Just checking the my bets section is temperamental. Awful and needs a fix!",2020-10-08 16:12:13,2

Keep being told there is a problem and to check emails. Uninstalled and used alternative instead which was much better.,2022-04-09 09:20:02,1
168,williamhill,"Signed up for a special offer odds on the Super Bowl. They created my account, took my first deposit from me, and then didn't provide the odds offered with the sign-up code.

170,williamhill,Relatively easy to use app if you know how to look everywhere to find what you want. Good quick returns on winnings and results. Cash out option seems to freeze more than I would like but that's a personal thing.,2021-12-10 19:55:02,4
171,williamhill,I've won alot on this APP. It's easy to navigate and understand what it is your trying to bet on. Other Apps make it confusing to place Bonus bets etc but this one is great My only issue is if you sometimes withdraw some winnings you will find that you won't win for along time and you will lose your money that you deposit. So keep your winnings in your account for as long as possible,2022-05-26 19:11:04,5
172,williamhill,"Many issues with this app- promotions are misleading, you get multiple messages saying you have free spins but are unable to claim them! This happens a lot. They also have a contact chat line but I don't believe anyone works there, you can be on hold for a long time and once you leave the app your place in queue is gone. These issues do not appear to happen on an iOS phone (apple). They also void bet builders if you're player gets sent off, despite you putting them to be carded!! Go elsewhere.",2022-01-31 09:10:18,1

Its so glitchy. when you leave the app for second to check a stat it jumps back to the home page all the time ,when building an acca, if you click into a fixture for odds other than WDW then go back you are directed back to the very top of the fixture list.

181,williamhill,Good app. I believe many people's work on it. There is a lot of options and bets. Sometimes many people's are log in and the advertisings make the app works slow. I think all sports in one app is too much.If the sports and card games are in two different apps will make the apps working better.Tghis is my opinion.

190,williamhill,The latest update on the app now is really bad because it keeps reloading all the time when you close the app and get back to it for just a short period. This slows up betting if you want to bet on something quickly. Kindly fix this problem.,2020-06-21 03:35:10,1

277,williamhill,Not great new to betting and the wording of getting the 30 free bets is rubbish and not clear atall. I placed £10 bet but didn't realise it needed to be in 1 bet.

The poorest selection of live bets on any game regardless of the sport you betting,on the market.

281,williamhill,out of all the betting apps I have used this is the worst one. have tried it for about a week and about the only good thing about it is the booster. Whenever trying to place a bet it keeps saying I have insufficient funds and eventually when it does put the bet on I have to cash out again because it put less than what I wanted so I have to put all the bet in again. the cashout option is also about 5-10 minutes behind and the cashout rarly works. anytime i leave the app I have to login again.,2019-01-26 21:51:27,1

Before they pay you winnings they ask for selfies of you holding your handwritten username, 2 separate bank statements, passport, info on how your bank is funded. They ask for all of this bit-by-bit instead of upfront which drags out the process. I have had around 3 weeks of this to withdraw my winnings. No phone number to call, just slow emails or poor chat feature on their website. I have not had this experience with other bookies.",2022-02-26 06:37:39,1

285,williamhill,the app is just full of faults from the dodgy connection if you want to watch football. To the many issues I have just trying to place bets. scary thing is these guys are top 3 in the country in my opinion. so guys take it from a gambler who's operated all apps for a number of years BET 365 SKYBET top 1 and 2 any are better than these guys.

351,williamhill,Keeps freezing and not letting me into all the functions.,2022-10-08 12:38:49,1
352,williamhill,Someone out there needs to design a betting app that has a simplistic layout. Who knows where to look when they access this app? I ain't got a clue me. Doesn't matter how many times I use it either. Also why do I need to wait for a little red box to appear at the bottom before I can view my current betslip? Please sort it out.,2020-02-11 15:18:15,2

They claim that an email was sent but only received an email after I inquired about the account. Will go with another provider who wants my custom. I think the reason they closed my account is because I didn't top up my account straight away! Very disappointed, poor service and definitely will not be recommending.",2021-07-06 16:24:52,1
356,williamhill,Horrendous. Everytime you load up an accumulator then click on bet slip to show the bet the app freezes. Need to close and reopen. Then its usually taken a leg off the accumulator. Terrible app.,2019-10-25 12:58:43,1

361,williamhill,"Keeps logging me out. Can't handle being busy and crashes during main events. Absolute utter rubish, changes password rules which mean your password wont work anymore. Not worth the one star but had to put one.",2019-07-27 10:41:48,1

372,williamhill,Wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Doesn't seem to be very fairplay at all in my experience. I've spent 500 pounds in one week without any returns on games where theres thousand pounds jackpots hourly supposedly. Bonus games are extremely rare whereas on other gambling sites they are more frequent. Really surprised at this regarding how big and well known this company is but this is definitely the worst for returns. Sky vegas has better games and is a much more generous site.,2019-12-03 10:19:35,1
373,williamhill,What a mess this app really is. I bet on football everyday and the in game stats are so incorrect it's crazy. Some games have between one and 4 penalties but in the actual game there was none. If I was betting on penalties I would be livid thinking I was winning. Get it sorted william or I'm removing my account.,2020-12-25 09:20:41,1

My Winnings come in quick ready to bet on the next race most don't give me my Winnings in time to make more bets. Also William Hill pay both when a stuards enquiry comes and places in races get switched around.. Also get lots of promos and genuinly do win a lot of the time.. got lots of freebies and the cash I withdraw comes to my bank quicker than most. Also Good odds boosts 👍,2021-11-30 07:00:38,5

395,williamhill,App works fine for first couple of weeks(then the problems begin) then your account gets blocked for verification even though you verify at the start. Asked them to delete my account coz customer service is useless told that it is not possible to delete for 7 years due to there privacy policy. Deleted app keep getting useless emails.

Even bets sometimes sneaky way u want to bet this amount and other amount pop out as I placed 4 bets same time apparently ( untrue obviously ) technical issues on settling bet still customer lose on that.

442,williamhill,Search function doesn't work ans so finding bets has to be done the long way. So poor for a company this big. All leagues don't show up on daily list either so manual search of a bet can take 5 or 10 times longer than any other company,2022-08-26 16:11:58,1
443,williamhill,Every time I do the disc drop and win free spins I get kicked from the app . When I try to do the promotions the screen freezes.,2022-08-18 02:47:23,2

448,williamhill,"Used to love this as my betting site but has gone downhill so much over last few months. Bonuses not working, wrong prices, cash out going down when you want to claim it, bets not placing and they always blame you're device even though you use different ones. They were so much better than others but sadly becoming the worst.",2022-04-13 08:49:18,2

I don't win much I do it for fun but when you don't even have a fair chance it makes it impossible. I hope more people notice this,2022-04-13 10:52:30,1
452,williamhill,Nightmare app. Bonus drop doesn't always work. Eye of Horusnot allowing the free spins. T's & C's not clear on free spins etc. Sky is 100 times better. Only using this for Irish Lottery. Thankfully won't be using for anything else,2020-04-30 05:34:39,2

457,williamhill,Used to be reliable but since the latest update it keeps glitching out. Pages just go blank or show lines on the screen and the open bets tab is the same. Hard to follow the bets or see your cash out.,2020-10-17 08:03:20,3
458,williamhill,Constantly logs me out for no reason! My bets also appear empty or I am unable to view them. Overall very buggy at the minute. Shame as it used to be the best betting app in my opinion.,2022-07-09 06:02:51,2

460,williamhill,Why have you changed an app that worked perfectly before. New update terrible. It tells me I have no open bets when I know I have so if you want to cash in then you can't....obviously a way to keep money. Dreadful....time to download another betting app.,2020-09-05 11:13:41,1

468,williamhill,What's happened. Used to be a good app with a large variety of markets. Now if I place some bets and I go to my betslip it disappears. What's happened. People won't be able to bet if this is going on with them. I have to use another betting app now.,2020-07-15 15:16:29,3

472,williamhill,Account was restricted today because I was winning more than I was losing. Kind of ironic it happened during their safer gambling week. Guess William Hill view it as making it safer for them to take money and restrict those that win more then they lose.,2022-10-20 13:32:56,1
473,williamhill,"Match visualization is so old and obsolete, its really rubbish compared to the betfair version also the other day it wouldn't show the scores on my selections it only said live,there has been numerous issues recently that prompted me to deposit money in my other betting apps,I will say however William hill is no1 for boosting bets and also I love the weekly bet on Tuesday's when you pick 6 matches with 3 or 4 goals in the match,that I really love",2021-01-22 14:31:15,3

475,williamhill,Doesn't offer enough cash outs on bets ie when placing bets each way but I like that ya can place as little as 1p on accumulators where as on sky bet the least you can bet is 5p but sky bet has a better lay out and easier to use. I use both of these as are the better gambling apps I've tried and would recommend William Hill as easy to use and has lots of promotions.,2020-04-11 10:54:29,4

478,williamhill,Good betting app but the reason it's 3 star is the fact that whenever you wanna cash in it never let's you it's permanently suspended don't have the cash in feature if it can't be used other than that it's a good betting app easy to navigate and good amount of categories.,2021-06-27 19:59:44,3

550,williamhill,"Be very careful with this app as took 1000 out off my acount, when I placed 100 pound bet. Had no help or support after, now I can't get on the site!

Sorry Bet Bull & Ladbrokes it is then.",2021-02-04 08:58:23,1

572,williamhill,Stay away from this casino. Totally rip off. Playing couple weeks sometimes 300-400 spins without single bonus. Slots lagging so badly. Customer service always telling u its your Internet connection. For me 1 star is to much but unfortunately there's no 0.,2021-04-03 08:11:23,1
573,williamhill,This site used to be one of the good ones but since its been updated just can't win or get any features any more I know it's called gambling and should expect to lose sometimes but this is just basically giving them money with very very very low chance of winning would recommend using a different site,2022-08-11 19:22:30,1

654,williamhill,"This android app is functionally just the same as the old web version for horse race betting.

Edit: William Hill want you to email them pics of yourself holding Passport or Drivers licence. They'll still take your original £10 stake but won't give you your free bets unless you send them pics.

1711,williamhill,EPIC ODDS are a scam and they may toss you a few winners to draw you in. Free spins are a rig and you'll find this out if you have them legally uncomfortable. Build a bet is rigged right now Brentford vs Liverpool. if you bet Brentford and btts you'll get 10/1 unless you use build a bet then it's 8/1 ? This is a Scam company that's been alive too long. Go with a younger company that hasn't quite William hilled it yet. Gambling 10 years ago wasn't like it is now. It's a just a scam nowadays.,2023-01-02 13:26:24,1

5060,williamhill,Used to love this app but now that Covid-19 has started William Hill are getting a bit to involved in there customers business. They even wanted a bank statement off of me to make sure that I could afford what I laid out on bets. Because I refused to show them any kind of income they put a £50 limit on my account. I'm RADGING at them but unfortunately it's my favourite betting app. I will be betting allot less with William Hill and will be looking for a new bookies.,2020-11-21 05:57:34,1

5276,williamhill,"Firstly, ignore the rating for this app. I know for certain that some 5 star reviews have been written by William Hill employees... Problems include football scores not being updated, meaning cashing out values are incorrect. I'm not talking at points in the game where there are possible penalties, red cards etc...this is teams taking the lead and the app not updating the score for anything from 5-20mins, despite relaunching app etc. Very unreliable, there's plenty of superior alternatives!",2019-08-10 09:13:10,1

Bombarded with ""offers"" that have mention small amounts in headlines like £10 but then have huge wagering requirements to be enacted £200 + quid approx.. when I asked to close account the agent just did it with no advise on what to with my balance or active bets. It was bloody disgraceful.",2019-06-25 11:02:32,1

5637,williamhill,Poor poor app. Just copy the Skybet app lads and stop trying to make betting so difficult. Accumulator building is shocking. It shouldn't be this hard to give you my easily lost money 2019. lots of changes. much much better well done. almost as good as the rivals on the sports betting. would be better if it was easier to have short cuts to your favourite sports or a repeat bet function I.e 2-1 scoreline etc. but certainly a vast improvement. personally I'd get rid of the bet boost too.,2019-02-23 03:37:53,4
5638,williamhill,Used to work well but now freezes without notice and can infuriate to the point off giving up.often asks me to sign in before placing a bet when i already am... little niggles but niggles non the less..,2019-04-21 10:53:58,3

6156,williamhill,"Have been a very happy customer for a while but 3 times in the last couple of months I've had cash outs fail. 300 quid, 100 quid and 50 quid. Rang customer services and they said that the markets had changed without any warning. This was after I had confirmed my acceptance of the cash out offer. Basically I've been cheated. Avoid the app and the company. I'm going back to skybet.",2018-09-29 09:56:26,1
6157,williamhill,"I had an I phone and the app work very well on that, but with Android this app is very noticeably terrible. It's slower, less responsive, less functional. You don't have access to all the football teams playing, I also have an iPad so I can check and I gave to re-do best that do give full coverage on the phone.",2018-09-02 07:20:41,1
6158,williamhill,"EDIT: so it turns out they do read them. That's about the extent of it though. Emailed them but with no response...... Does anybody even read these ? If we're just talking about the app then yeah, it's decent. I'd say it's one of the best out there but not the best. It's simple enough to use navigating through the menus etc....there is room for improvement like with most apps. It's a shame we don't have more of an input as to how it should look and work. I can guarantee that my ideas would make this the best app out there !",2018-08-27 13:56:24,4
6159,williamhill,The new set up for virtual football betting is not helping at all because u decide to take off the total goals from one to four and left over and under 2.5 .. We can no more bet just on one goal or just three goals in virtual football betting any more why. You need to fixed this back,2018-09-06 10:21:28,1

6162,williamhill,"It's an easy way to get your bets in, but the layout is a little difficult for new people and on top when I tried to payout certain bets it wouldn't let me so the the amount I was allowed was much lower by the time I could withdraw it.",2018-08-29 02:35:38,4
6163,williamhill,"Absolutely useless on the latest Android phones. Keeps deciding its own page, retains the teams on the slip after the bets made, does not give up to date scores which affects cash out! Use my last £5 and go elsewhere!",2018-09-01 13:53:02,1
6164,williamhill,Need to fix the both teams to score coupons. Would be so much better if had 1- a UK both teams to score list for that day. 2- both teams to score for that day worldwide list.,2018-08-25 08:20:30,3

6711,williamhill,"Probably the best bookmaker app available right now. The logging out problem only lasted a few days and it's fine now. William Hill Radio and Betting TV is the best part of the app. Watch all U.K. greyhound racing and U.S. Horse Racing for free with no need to place a bet first. Shame the server gets so overloaded the TV is subject to frequent buffering, but it's getting better and it's far more than any other bookmaker app offers, so thumbs up all round for this app.",2018-03-27 08:29:37,5

6880,williamhill,Does it,2018-03-21 16:47:08,5
6881,williamhill,This is a bad app. Seen lots of bad reviews but gave it a chance. Always seems to crash or stall when I want to cash in and my signal works perfectly well with Sky bet and bet 365. Also they make you wait longer than any other company for your money back. They take it instantly! but when you withdraw you have to wait for days! They say 3/5 but with Sky bet and bet 365 and 888 and paddy power I've never waited more than a couple of hours if not instantly.  It ruins the app because if you have money coming and have to wait you can't bet. Sky bet is spit 9n and bet 365 is very good. I wouldn't use this company again in till these issues are sorted out.,2018-02-23 14:00:24,1
6882,williamhill,intrusive adds and not easy to find out how to turn off notifications so removed app and no longer using William hill.,2018-03-04 13:10:17,2

6886,williamhill,Top app IMHO willys beat 365 and sky bet in an all rounder. It's all about beating the bookies. Get ya sen' over here,2018-03-09 11:13:20,5

6889,williamhill,Overall not a bad app. Can be glitchy and fiddly sometimes but odds boost makes up for it.,2018-03-03 13:54:34,4
6890,williamhill,App has crashed twice and doesn't allow auto login even though I opted in for it. All my details have been reset and now gave up.,2018-03-03 06:35:58,3

6957,williamhill,"Not a bad app but room for some serious improvement. Very slow at times and when you leave the app and go back into it, it often hangs forcing you to close the app from the tabs menu and then open it again. Very frustrating. Also very slow when putting on multiple bets.  Come on William Hill, I'm sure your Apple app doesn't have these niggling problems. How about you treat your Android users the same way and give us a polished app experience",2018-01-06 11:59:00,3
6958,williamhill,"So slow its like betting in 1982. App is terrible in many ways  doesnt store odds preferences via account settings and takes so log to load. Always says poor connection even if connection is strong. Crashes. Its just awful. Use the mobile site, which is just as bad but at least it doesnt take up space on your phone.",2018-02-06 15:07:35,1
6959,williamhill,I think Im losing my mind. Does anyone know how to switch to decimal odds for UK/IRE horse racing on this app as I prefer to work with decimal as opposed to fractional. I have checked in all the settings and cant seem to find the option. I can switch decimal on the main site ok. Come on William Hill please get the app updated and move with the times. If the option is already there and I just cant seem to see the woods for the trees. I will happily give it 5 stars and removed the comments.,2018-02-09 09:08:57,3
6960,williamhill,Your adds on websites keep automatically opening the app store and trying to get me to download this.  It means you seem about as trust worthy as spammers. If I was going to have a gambling app you can bet your bottom dollar I would not use one that uses such untrustworthy methods of getting customers.  Your morality and decency standards are shocking I hope more people see this tactic the way I do. You can't be trusted!,2017-12-18 11:34:23,1
6961,williamhill,"It is an awful app. It always says ""poor connection"" when you want to place a bet and have to log off. Sort connection out because you are making us lose out on in play bets. You phone customer services and they dont do anything really. Can William Hill not see connection complaints here?",2017-12-17 05:32:45,1
6962,williamhill,"So glitchy its unreal. I don't know how many times this app doesn't work. 
The other day I hit cash in button about 4 mins before the race was off & 
just gave me the loading screen & never gave me my cash back. Today it gave 
me the cash in offer of £83 & when I hit it £51 appeared in my account 
without it asking me if I accept any changes. Contacted them but they won't 
listen. Their app doesn't work properly & I'm the one paying the price. 
Avoid this app!",2018-05-05 16:01:21,1

I can't say if this applies regarding all aspects of the site,but so far has been very poor.Even when you send a query regarding a bet to customer service,they are very slow in responding.I distinctly have the impression resolving an issue will be long winded and frustrating.My other betting app is far more transparent and informative,without having to spend ages trying to find the relevant info. Well done on a fantastic app 🤔 ,not.",2018-01-05 13:00:05,1

6982,williamhill,Shocking on android. Had an iPhone before and this app ran perfectly. On android it's useless. Just tried to place a in play bet. App froze bet was not placed and the bet came in. Lost money.,2017-12-16 14:49:26,1

6992,williamhill,"William Hill have never been able to get an App working properly. Very slow and unresponsive. Their website is actually better than this, but still not great. Much better betting apps out there.",2018-02-03 11:24:43,1
6993,williamhill,"The worst betting app out there. 90% of the time it doesn't work and when it does it's slow and jumpy. Honestly William hill should sue the people who built this app for them, it's pure sabotage!",2018-02-09 04:23:44,1
6994,williamhill,"This app is terrible...poor connection when trying to place a bet, if you go on the internet and use that instead of the app you can place bets with no problem, this app needs to be fixed, previous app was much better",2018-01-25 18:42:09,1
6995,williamhill,Freezes quite often and takes a while to load. But I love the #YourOdds,2017-12-03 10:11:09,4

6998,williamhill,It's ok. But placing bets with Hills through the Racing Post app us easier and quicker,2017-12-09 08:48:10,3
6999,williamhill,A bit slow putting in play bets on but offers a top notch,2017-12-26 09:41:45,3
7000,williamhill,"This is the worse sports betting app by far, too complicated to use, can't picture a both teams to score for UK leagues, Sky Bet blows it out the water.Will Hill just can't get it right, keep it simple.",2017-12-30 07:32:29,1
7001,williamhill,STOP!!!!!! I will give it one star only because I can't give none Slow connection and problems when you want to look at your betting slip and when you email them with problems they don't have the decency to email you back and as for live chat dont bother its like talking to robots never get a proper answer to your questions It's not worth the hassle stay clear of this app ....,2018-01-31 16:28:04,1

7009,williamhill,Can be really slow when trying to put on several accumulator bets. The app could also have an option to be able to select 3 draws in the Irish lottery instead of having to input each draw manually,2017-12-27 12:47:49,3
7010,williamhill,"I experienced the same connection issue alot of previous reviews mention within 5mins of using app! Disappointing. Definately nothing wrong with wifi, this is the app. Sort it out William Hill!",2018-01-31 15:06:33,1

7133,williamhill,No. I won't confirm I'm in England. You don't state it is for UK users only. I'm in a country where you allow gambling and take my money (lots of it) without question. But your app is still well below par. Average would be bigging it up. Closed my account and gone elsewhere. I see you still have loads of 1 stars,2017-10-30 20:09:09,1
7134,williamhill,"I never bother to write reviews but I just had to for this. Absolutely shocking app. Constantly struggles to load anything, tells me I'm not signed in even though I can access my balance, account, etc. Viewing your open bets is always a struggle and can cost you money. Loads of shite.",2017-10-14 05:13:56,1
7135,williamhill,The app has got better but still needs work. A little difficult to navigate and some frequently used functions are hidden away. The auto login keeps turning itself on. I dont want it on in case I lose my phone which is why I turn it off. Every time I log on it turns it back on again and I have to remember to turn it off. Bit of a security issue if you ask me.,2017-11-04 09:33:52,3
7136,williamhill,"The old app was much better, this is a nightmare. Very difficult to place a bet - which should be the core function  of a betting app - as it regularly fails to load the betslip. Also regularly fails to recognise me, even though I'm auto logged in. Think I'll take my business elsewhere...",2017-10-07 04:41:33,1
7137,williamhill,"There are some great elements to this app; the layout is good, the enhanced boost feature is good and when it works it's great.  Unfortunately like others have said it crashes too often and doesn't let you access elements of your account at times despite showing you as logged in.  Too many times I've been sat with my balance showing yet can't place a bet as I'm not logged in?  As for checking open bets it's a total lottery as to whether it'll work.  Think I may head elsewhere.",2017-10-07 10:03:47,2
7138,williamhill,"I don't really know why I've kept on using WH on my mobile because it causes nothing but problems. The connectivity is dreadful and the whole active bets look is dreadful. Take SkyBet for instance, their cash out page looks great. Maybe William Hill can take notes on that set out because I've decided to go back to SkyBet because it's so much better in terms of page layouts and connectivity",2017-11-03 10:46:15,2
7139,williamhill,"App is pants and was far better before it was updated for the play store. Half the time won't load so have to shut down and start again, meaning in play betting is impossible. Also gone off using them due to not using 0.5 for over and unders like every other bookie as it seems like a way to con inexperienced gambler's. Also cash out price is pants, 4 out of 6 games already won, barca and real left on slip and they offer barely more than your stake whilst bet Victor offered me 36x there cash out offer on the same bet.",2017-10-01 11:27:10,2
7140,williamhill,"Oh my god this app is terrible. I thought the old one was bad but this Google Play version is dreadful. I'm so frustrated with it. Select a team and wait for hours as it fails to add to your bet slip. In fact just about any selection within the interface has exactly the same lag, buffer, stall...calll it what you want. I can't imagine what In Play betting is like!",2017-09-22 10:11:19,1
7141,williamhill,"Made the mistake of deleting the old app, this new one is about as much use as a condom with the end cut off. Won't let me place bets, keeps freezing and skipping. Sort it out or I'll just go with another company to bet with.",2017-09-23 03:40:10,1

7143,williamhill,OMG sort this app out. No matter if you are using WiFi or Data the app says Internet connection error and is totally unusable. I prefer William Hill to all the other bookies but if I can't use their app I'll have to use a rival brand.,2017-10-21 11:00:56,1
7144,williamhill,Too slow and laggy. You guys have got to sort this out as has been like this for months now. Commercially this is costing you money as I can't place late / quick bets due to the problems.,2017-10-14 05:12:56,3
7145,williamhill,DREADFUL avoid avoid avoid. Things a joke can't cash out because open bets doesn't show takes a week to put simple bets on COMPLETE WASTE,2017-09-23 09:29:17,1
7146,williamhill,"This app is useless compared to other similar companies. Very slow and by the time you want to place a bet in play, the odds have changed four or five times. Easier to just use the mobile site on your phones browser",2017-11-09 06:32:52,1
7147,williamhill,Absolute garbage. Does not have cash out option in open bet slip as it says it does. Will continue with old app or go elsewhere if that stops working.,2017-11-26 09:57:22,1

7151,williamhill,Sometimes my placed bets do not show unless I hit the Home button which seems to refresh it. During bets testing I suggested putting the cashout button at the top of the bet but you didn't. Scrolling down a 6+ Acca is a pain.,2017-09-21 07:36:11,4

7165,williamhill,Crashes all the time absolutely useless the layout I can't fault but you don't use a betting app for the lay out. Not the best odds either so overall I wouldn't ever recommend this app,2017-10-30 18:20:34,1
7166,williamhill,"This app is horrendously unreliable. It locks up, sometimes just has the timer icon on continuously when trying to select a team, and worst of all has push notifications constantly. I only do accas and the odd racing bet so give me the option to not be pushed tennis or any notifications for that matter.  Update: downloaded the app for the second time to see if it had improved. Slightly better reliability although if you put a value in to check acca odds, it stores a value even after going back and selecting another team and will put two bets on. Ended up with a four team treble after adding another team to a normal three team win acca as left the bet value in. It is just really poor usability. Not great odds and better apps with other bookies so recommend going elsewhere if you do online betting. Who beta tested this rubbish!",2017-11-01 18:00:31,1

7169,williamhill,On the new app. Looks better than the old one. But constantly freezes when trying to place a bet. Crazy. Freezes when wanting to cash out. These are basics. Also finding the option to change to decimals took ages. Should be in settings menu. Skybet is the best app I've come across by a mile.,2017-10-17 17:35:01,2

7385,williamhill,👍👍👍👍👍,2017-10-08 22:58:44,5
7386,williamhill,Just horrible how bad this app is I have just getting a new top end phone a thought I would try it out again as I always just used chrome.. but there new app is just as bad if not worse.. trying to bet on something simple like daily list of football and all you get is the refresh icon all the time.. so frustrating,2017-09-16 01:45:04,1
7387,williamhill,"Slow slow slow and doesn't always work even on brilliant Internet connection. Broken, stumbles. It's like you don't want my money I've persisted for a month and had my account for over ten years with william Hill. Now this app has finally broken me im off. Would advise nobody to download app",2017-09-10 03:56:02,1
7388,williamhill,"Glitchy as anything. Constantly telling me I have no internet connection when I do. Selecting bets is a lottery as to whether they go through or I'll sit watching a loading symbol for five minutes, reverses every withdrawal I make of my winnings ... potential to be a great betting app if it worked properly, which it doesn't.",2017-09-05 05:16:07,2
7389,williamhill,"Absolutely rubbish app. Sits there thinking for ages when you try and add something to your bet slip. Takes about 2 minutes to show if you have any live bets when you reopen the app so if you are looking at cashing in on your acca in good time think again. Other betting companies have much better apps, they need to completely rejig it. Judging by the comments on here I'm not the only annoyed customer.",2017-09-16 02:37:43,1
7390,williamhill,"Poor app. Very slow, often states no internet connection and wont let you post bets. It is not my connection that is the problem. It kicked me out of the auto login function and then wouldn't accept my login details even though the desktop version would. Had to go on live chat to fix it (3 days ago). Now today it has done the same again, my login details dont work in the app but do in chrome. Deleted the app as it's a waste of time trying to use it",2017-09-19 09:39:15,1
7391,williamhill,"Its great when it works.   Its the only betting app I've ever used. Something about the brand name draws me to it over the others. The layout is clear and UI is user friendly. Plus no charge on withdrawals which is nice.  However, recently, for large periods of time the app hangs / reports ""no internet connection"" when it is defiantly not a problem with my internet. During these periods I can't place any bets. (The icon just spins) and I cannot access any of the menus on the bottom navigation bar. So I've missed out on some bets recently. This is only made more aggravating when I can see my friend on the IOS version working perfectly.  If the hanging can be sorted, I can't think of anything else they need to add.",2017-09-04 18:03:33,2
7392,williamhill,"App gets stuck during live betting even if your internet connection is great. I accidentally cashed-in a live football bet (I basically cancelled it for  those unfamiliar with the terms) and by the time I could place it again the odds were far lower (the app was stuck for about 10 minutes!!!). The William Hill customer service is also very rude and patronizing as they insisted ""there were no issues with the app today"" when I called to file a complain. Terrible experience! There are far better options out there.",2017-08-29 14:34:01,1
7393,williamhill,Really good app but not sure it has been developed in the best way...massively drains the phone battery. Has got even worse and when trying to select a bet it just hangs with the spinning wheel of death...missed out on placing many winning bets now due to this.,2017-09-18 16:23:46,1
7394,williamhill,"This app did work when first installed. Found my account, cards and PayPal at first log in. Had all previous bets and upcoming bets placed on an internet browser showing on my account. However it is very frustrating having to turn on location every time I sign in.  The app also has not been working properly, recently. I press on bets but they do not appear on my bet slip. The bet just hangs/loops as if waiting on a connection. Was OK when first used but not working now.  Would recommend users to wait until they fix small flaws. Potential for a great app but small bugs/clitches need addressed....  After uninstalling and re installing all bugs were fixed and I can now bet again.",2017-09-05 14:13:11,5
7395,williamhill,"The app always seems to crash, and is slow as anything.  The odds always seem to change when you try to place a bet.  You can't get a daily list up, it just shows you the current day.  If these problems are not fixed by next weekends premier fixtures, il changes to a more reliable provider.",2017-09-03 17:24:43,2
7396,williamhill,Oh my god! Why do companies update an app to make it so rubbish it's unusable!! The slowest app I have ever used! It froze for so long I tried again to place a bet as it said no bet was placed. Guess what? It placed 2 bets and took my money twice. Do not use!! I will be deleting it,2017-09-06 07:18:58,1
7397,williamhill,"You need to sort this app out, takes forever to place a bet and last night when I had a bet on it didn't even show correct scores",2017-09-01 02:01:20,1
7398,williamhill,"Absolutely terrible betting app...  much slower than old. Putting on a bet is slow, the app does not show the score of live games in a coupon.  Going to stop using this app and only use bet365 their app is lightning fast and cash out is instant...",2017-09-16 11:56:41,1
7399,williamhill,"Poor app, even struggles with basic operations like removing debit cards,  and depositing funds (even though all fields are green, deposit button is greyed out). Too much effort for too little gain.",2017-09-03 06:41:09,1
7400,williamhill,"Decent UI but continually hanging. Too often says ""no/poor internet connection"" when I have good WiFi, & often doesn't move to anything after clicking on a button & I have to click on Home to start again. Just about keeping it for now.",2017-09-01 10:53:41,3
7401,williamhill,Useless. Only thing that worked was depositing money. No bet selections actually worked. Waited 10 min for live chat and the delay was so bad they left the convo. Gave up after over an hour of trying to one footie bet.,2017-09-16 05:55:46,1
7402,williamhill,Constantly logging me out of my account and not allowing me to place bets. Also says I never have an internet connection...very poor app leading me to consider leaving william hill,2017-09-04 17:25:13,1
7403,williamhill,Really awful app. Scored on your bet slip often disappear so you have to click on each individual game which takes an eternity. Bet slip often becomes un-viewable during match time. None of the updates have been good for years.,2017-09-16 10:31:16,1
7404,williamhill,"When on WiFi the app keeps saying ""No internet connection"" even though pages are loading okay. This makes using the app pretty annoying.",2017-09-03 11:10:02,2
7405,williamhill,Updated its got worse doesnt load bet slip freezes really needs sorting asap very dissatisfied.............Very annoying i have to turn on location every time i open app and quite often gets stuck loading up. Still very glitchy one football score said 2-2 so i cashed out then changed to 2-1 how is this fair at all!!!,2017-09-19 13:09:52,1
7406,williamhill,"The worst betting app ever. Doesn't load, says no Internet connection. Can't place bets. I have been with wh for more than five years. Have just withdrawn my money and am downloading paddy power.....",2017-09-16 05:22:39,1
7407,williamhill,"Constantly lags, very little functionality when going beyond the homepage... Had no problems with the old app",2017-09-07 15:59:55,1
7408,williamhill,Not sure why WH keep asking for account details to look into issues. The problem is obviously the app.,2017-09-16 03:29:22,2
7409,williamhill,"Took my money on fake bets, looked at results saw my bet won, didn't not pay out. No loading live bets TOTAL SCAM",2017-09-08 16:46:45,1

7411,williamhill,"Absolutely shockingly bad, didn't know it was possible to get it so wrong. Just doesn't work anymore",2017-09-15 07:42:48,1
7412,williamhill,Can't even place a bet as the icon just spins around in circles when tapping on the odds.  Useless.,2017-08-31 04:42:58,1
7413,williamhill,Need lots of improvement and fixes. Live chat is good but doesn't resume after you navigate away from apps or open something else for few secs.,2017-08-25 08:00:56,1
7414,williamhill,App has more bugs than the average bed. Do not download if you want to place a quick bet ;-(,2017-09-15 07:44:21,1
7415,williamhill,"Freezes. Doesn't always let me bet and often can't see open bets for cash out! Useless. Once account is empty will leave, unistall and go somewhere else.",2017-09-17 07:39:34,1
7416,williamhill,Can't see any open or settled bets. Just a blank screen. Old app was better,2017-08-27 11:05:39,2
7417,williamhill,"Not even one star! -5* and we may be getting close! Old app was much better! This is so unresponsive, if I was WH I would take the app down altogether until you can produce something that works and is fit for purpose!   Probably going to close my account and go elsewhere, had enough of this rubbish.",2017-09-09 17:28:55,1
7418,williamhill,Old app was far superior. This hangs all the time. Some times the accumulator is at the top and sometimes at the bottom. Absolutely terrible. Tbh if it doesn't improve ill go and bet with someone else. Wish i never deleted the old one.,2017-09-12 14:59:13,1
7419,williamhill,"So frustrating. Unresponsive. Has to be continually restarted. Stats page takes dozen times to load. Slow, slow, slow. Not good for quick live bets. Use desktop site instead.",2017-09-16 15:20:32,1

7421,williamhill,"Not what you would expect from a big betting firm the app is slow, keeps loging you out oh and when you try to put a bet on it takes so long you would need to bet 15min before race then you wouldn't gaurentee to be on. Total waste of time .",2017-09-19 10:01:46,1
7422,williamhill,Trying to place a bet it just loads and loads and doeant go into your betting slip. What is the point of the app if you cant even place a bet. Too many bugs.,2017-09-18 13:22:29,1
7423,williamhill,"Not very good app, I put a bet on then after close app to do another bet. And when I go to check my bets it shows my bet slip is empty so you even lose out on cash out....",2017-09-17 09:08:18,2
7424,williamhill,The app is far too glitchy. At times i cant access my open bets and it often becomes totally unresponsive. If things dont improve i will have to take my custom elsewhere.,2017-09-08 16:05:12,1
7425,williamhill,"This app freezes all the time and most annoyingly when trying to place a bet. Terrible app, stick to using the mobile site.",2017-08-26 15:06:08,1
7426,williamhill,"Why is there no way to switch of notifications - that's marketing and should be controllable. App often 'freezes'. Old side-load version was much better, no notifications and it actually worked!",2017-09-13 14:23:29,1
7427,williamhill,I ceased to use William hill around 2 year ago and used someone else after what was a bit of a falling out but I knew I'd be back using William hill again and here I am.much MUCH  improved in everyway that'll needed improving although I still find the sites virtuals a bit confusing but I'll sort that.thanks William hill,2017-08-26 14:38:10,5

So they wouldn't give me my money on a bet I know I won on. Also never got my money back for the error they made. My advice is don't bother with them. Cause they are a rip off,2018-01-02 20:27:20,1
