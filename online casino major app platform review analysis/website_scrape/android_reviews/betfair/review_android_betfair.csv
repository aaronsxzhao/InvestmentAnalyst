0,betfair,"The performance of the current version of this app is shocking. It takes at least 30 seconds to complete any action. Every week, I put a small bet on my Super 6 accumulator. This week, I knew it would take 10 mins with this app to get it done, so didn't bother. For the first time in about 2 years, I would actually have won. I missed out on around ¬£100 because this app is unusable. Tried clearing data, uninstalling / reinstalling, using data / wireless... Performance-wise, worst app I've used.",2019-03-30 13:32:47,1
1,betfair,Fed up with it not working. It tells me to update to latest version and I have checked. When I deposit a blank screen comes up so I have to open exchange app to try that way. Now the home page doesn't load and when I click sports it only offers me virtual. Amazing the biggest betting company can't get an app right. Also the tab icons up top of screen I push and it opens something completely different. Usually roulette. Shall I continue?,2019-08-08 16:05:49,1
2,betfair,"I love how much stats are available. Everything from what's happened in the last 5, 10, 15 mins to team form, head to head etc. It's all information I previously had to use other websites to make informed bets. The website is also very sturdy and unlike other bookies it never crashes. The only downsides are that it is a bit slow and clunky to use and it could pay out quicker. Overall a great site and a great app.",2018-12-16 09:01:59,4
3,betfair,They still cant make an update to keep the screen on the last position when u pick a bet and want to go back to pick another... used to go back to the front of the page.. now after the last update every time u go back to pick another bet for the accum. It just goes to the bottom of the screen and i have to scroll the whole way back looking for the the match i want. Its so frustrating and time consuming . By the time i find it . Every thing has already changed. And as always the contact page through the help section coming as error page not available. Whats the f.....,2018-12-16 06:16:05,1
4,betfair,"Very accessible site moving from one sport to another,easy to deposit and to withdraw,could do with a few more free bets and promotions but only being cheeky overall good site,could do with a page for Irish lottery that's why scoring overall 4",2023-01-27 15:28:18,4
5,betfair,"In general is a pretty good app, but I got few thinks that I don't like and I want to see improved: cash out on ice hockey , a quicker time to unblock games after is locked for various reasons ( goal , red cards ...) .",2023-01-22 05:42:28,4
6,betfair,"Unable to trigger promotions so have to log in via the browser which is annoying. Still the app works better than William Hill which is terrible and Skybet which doesn't stream video properly. Not the apps fault, but had trouble with the Saturday bet promo not being paid, then a negative experience with customer service. Wish all bookies would distance themselves from the games aspects as they fuel addiction and result in affordability checks, though Betfair haven't requested these....yet",2023-01-28 08:37:19,3
7,betfair,"A great app. But recently updated the interface, I prefer the old look. Rate 4 stars until I can have the option of the old look.",2023-01-31 15:53:09,4
8,betfair,"New Update is awful, if you put a weekly acca like me then you will be missing matches as there seems to be only 10 matches per league max shown. You have to go and film them in a roundabout way. Can't even get the lower Scots leagues on the UK coupon. Shambles",2023-02-11 09:02:07,1
9,betfair,"Was 5* now awful ... Was my favourite but the new layout is muddled, the dark theme is horrible & it's glitchy. Crashes EVERY time I try to switch sections eg sports bets to casino. Roll it back to how it was please!",2023-01-12 06:35:01,1
10,betfair,Seems to constantly forget my password forcing me to attempt a reset.. oh and strangely the free bet offer never seems to materialize.. thought this was the best betting app but not sure how..,2023-01-23 07:59:22,1
11,betfair,"Terrible app since the new update, almost unusable. Also, just had my account closed for no reason and told I can't appeal or get it back, so yeah, don't bother basically üëçüèª",2023-02-03 16:58:24,1
12,betfair,"It's rubbish now, liked the old way, I can't go on football and find out who's upcoming to play like the old way, going to look at a new betting company, been on here for years, but now leaving",2023-01-31 08:23:17,1

16,betfair,It would have been higher a week ago but the new update made it slower and less reliable so I'm a bit disappointed with that. It's still better than most rivals,2023-02-01 14:10:25,3
17,betfair,Looks very basic compared to the old app which was more in depth . No A-Z of horses running and not as much info .,2023-02-10 15:40:27,1
18,betfair,The apps brilliant. One negative at the moment is when clicking on the app clicking on casino it logs you out and I've been having to log onto casino on chrome.,2023-01-19 14:50:06,5
19,betfair,Great betting app. changed the layouts of the app recently. should've kept it the same.,2023-02-02 16:32:25,4

21,betfair,They have changed the layout and I can't log in with my 4 digit pin I have used this so much that I forgot my original password so now I can't log in I will just stop using this app now very disappointed,2023-01-13 04:59:17,1
22,betfair,Why does this app have no search functionality? That seems a fairly fundamental thing to be missing from a betting app.,2023-01-17 06:27:53,2

24,betfair,Daily game is a joke. Haven't won for months and showing rewards on my page only to say I'm not eligible is a piss take. Hardly spend any money on this app now. Avoid,2023-01-13 03:05:39,1
25,betfair,Very Good offers and service. one slight negative you don't get guaranteed odds on multiple bets like lucky 15 for example other wise. Very good,2023-01-21 04:17:10,5
26,betfair,Not easy to understand how to put bets on onto check results found it hard to find the result of combination bets,2023-01-31 14:12:34,2

37,betfair,very difficult to navigate then old version,2023-01-31 12:44:49,1
38,betfair,"I actually really like the app but it is a pain to access the links at the top of the home page, such as odds boost or specials. Each time it asks me to login, so I do, and then it sends me back to the previous screen and asks me to login again... It's a real shame as I'd use the app more if it wasn't such a pain to access these features.",2022-12-03 13:49:05,2
39,betfair,Where has prize pinball gone? Can't find it since the recent update... also now not eligible for free bet promotion... cheers guys,2023-02-04 06:43:52,1

43,betfair,ruined it with the changes. go back to the old format please.,2023-01-18 15:59:03,1
44,betfair,"Good sports betting app - but casino doesnt work for me. Whenever I try to open the Prize Pinball or any slot it logs me out. I log back in and it does the same again. Not a major issue as it works via an internet browser, just an annoyance. Been like this for some time. EDIT Clearing the cache in app settings fixes this issue.",2022-11-26 10:54:08,5
45,betfair,This App is absolutely useless compared with the previous version. It takes to long to open the video playback is always stopping or sticking when watching horse racing trying to place a bet is a nightmare as you are constantly being stopped by prices changing back and forth of 1/4 points so must be costing BF a fortune in missed bets by punters. My Advice - Go Back To The Previous Version At Least It Was IT Meddle Proof.,2023-01-27 15:41:39,1
46,betfair,App good only downside is changing from sports to say games bit is a bit of a pain. Never had a issue with winnings and customer support are always helpful. But the thing I notice most is they try and resolve issues if they crop up. Which in my experience with bookies its there rules if you don't like it well tough.,2022-11-16 11:46:50,5
47,betfair,"Terrible. Keeps crashing. Closes check outs early but the worse of them all is that when you be, and go to my bets you can't see the live results of the games. Either you need to go to the previous page and search or use another app for that. Kinda dodgy",2022-12-03 08:13:44,1
48,betfair,Very poor delay on cash out option it's always suspended or disappeared,2023-01-17 15:23:51,3
49,betfair,"Good app, easy to use, costomer services are actually helpful if or when you need them (unlike bet365). Only downside I've had is that there aren't many options for Scottish lower leagues at times. Eg. There's only one game listed for the Scottish FA Cup 1st round but it's easy to bet on Jordanian or Nicaraguan games if you wish to.",2022-10-21 18:41:05,4
50,betfair,Bonuses awarded in a click bait format . Terrible.,2023-01-14 09:43:18,1
51,betfair,Doesn't work. Just shows first yellow screen with Betfair on and doesn't load. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Have tried restarting phone and then reinstalling. Have tried this with sports betting and exchange apps both having the same issue.,2022-12-07 20:45:35,1
52,betfair,"Good app, easy to find everything you need and want to bet on. Staff have been helpful in the past too. Keeping score is a little buggy on occaisio , if you place bets at half time you'll get a score notification for the half time result during the second half but it's not the end of the world.",2018-10-13 10:54:35,5
53,betfair,"I find this app very easy to use. I only ever use it for football though so can't comment on variety of sports available. For me personally, there is a good selection of generic betting options. Match odds, BTTS, HT/FT etc. It's easy to deposit and withdraw funds. But to be fair, I don't often withdraw! In general, I think it's a great, easy to use app for an amateur weekend gambler for fun like myself. For a serious, maybe even professional gambler I can only say give it a try.",2020-06-19 20:44:47,5
54,betfair,"The website and app are really slow, good luck trying to place any sort of bet or trade from 3-5 on a Saturday where the markets always get suspended",2023-01-12 12:37:14,5
55,betfair,Stay away from this rubbish betting company!!! Quick exampl. I placed a bet 3+ goals in 6 matches. 3 were there and the other 3 they had 2 goals already on second half. This was minute 55. I had cash out option but i knew there are more goals to be scored. Minute 70 i had 5 of 6 games and no more cash out option. As usual i lost on 1 goal but could not cash out anything. This happens all the time with this rubbish company. üóë STAY AWAY !!!,2022-11-02 18:14:35,1
56,betfair,"Unable to top up, need to use website",2023-01-29 09:05:15,1
57,betfair,"Outdated, compared to the competitors, this app does not have a search button. You have to struggle find a match or a player, search it by league, time of play etc. Would be much more easier to just have a search button üòâ",2022-10-24 03:32:37,3
58,betfair,"By far the best betting app on the market. The app runs smoothly, everything is easy to see unlike a few other sports betting apps I downloaded and then had to uninstall. They also have a free to play game for the first 30 days called 'Beat the drop' answer 12 questions and you win 1k providing you go all in all of the way or you can split the money. Absolutely outstanding value. Highly recommended it as I have already recommended it to a few mates who likes a Kevin Campbell now n then üòâ",2020-12-05 06:46:03,5
59,betfair,"Your app is completely unusable at the moment. Either lags a lot or doesnt work at all, opens up different things to what you chose, doesn't let you cash out quickly. It's actually a good way to save money. It has so many bugs, I dont even want to use it at the moment. I don't understand what has happened to it. It used to be fine. I have tried all the fixes in the other comments, no such luck.",2019-03-16 20:12:34,2

69,betfair,very helpful excellent service,2023-01-29 18:13:07,5
70,betfair,"Migrated from 365 due to their numerous login issues. This is easier to use and in general ok. There is some lag when taking some actions, but nothing to bad. Purely as an app review I'd give it 4 stars. However, I do get served offers that then never appear in the betslip. Also, I've not been given offers when I know I've met the criteria. (Additionally the no cash-out suspension claim appears to be false.) So it's ok, but my quest for a perfect app continues..",2022-04-26 13:17:47,3
71,betfair,"Full of bugs.. all time getting extremely slow making it impossible to bet live.. many times when you want to access the cash out field ot just doesn't open, you're supposed to see how are the games going on the teams you bet so you can decide if you keep the bet or you cash it out but yeah, most of times it gets so buggy you just literally can do nothing live.. don't recommend it to anyone.. use the website way better service.. and no the issue is not the phone, is a Samsung Galaxy S20+",2021-02-19 12:03:49,1

73,betfair,"Good app just need to add a few more options, like goal kicks and a wider range of corner bets etc, I hate having to switch to different betting apps for better odds and options, you should take a look at the others and implement them into yours, just an option but do love this app.",2021-08-25 11:53:35,4
74,betfair,the performance improvements introduced in Feb are in reality degradations. Still a great interface but practically unusable now unfortunately. 27 April 2019 update. performance of the app is now meeting expectations. updates over the last few weeks have really worked for me. thank you. Edit 10/5/19: the performance improvements introduced since have indeed improved performance. everything back to normal. thank you.,2019-05-11 11:14:09,4
75,betfair,"The app is definitely faster than others like Bet365 and ladbrokes. Feels more responsive and smooth. Looking at match stats whilst it's in play barely ever works, like it just won't load, and sometimes the scores it shows whilst in play are just wrong (for instance Brentford vs Liverpool said 2-2 when the game was 3-3).",2021-09-27 13:50:42,4

192,betfair,"I think it's a really dubious app ,in order to get money out it's asking for information like pics of Id, pics of bank card ,pics of utility bills. Avoid!",2022-11-25 13:52:05,1

206,betfair,"Misleading sign-up offers. Joined with the place ¬£10 earn ¬£40 free bet, found the deal on promotions in app and pressed bet now under the deal. It then took me to bets that were not eligible for the deal(exchange bets). Assuming pressing bet now underneath the deal I chose would take me to the right place I put a ¬£10 bet down and then found out I'm not eligible the sign-up offer. This is very frustrating as i only tried out Betfair due to this offer.",2022-05-03 10:11:50,1
207,betfair,I have used this for some time but I keep having to delete and reinstall as the deposit page won't load. I have given up placing a lot of bets as a result. It used to be a really good app.,2020-08-29 09:47:55,2

209,betfair,"Functional app but miles behind the competition in terms of looks, layout and usability. Feels like a lazy port of the mobile website. Surely betfair make enough to throw a few quid at a mobile developer?",2019-08-07 12:46:41,2
210,betfair,Great app....good layout only downside when you deposit the money goes straight into your account but when you make a withdrawal it can take up to 5 days before it's in your account...but that's no big deal,2019-12-12 09:42:25,4
211,betfair,Very good Many thanks easy to use.,2023-01-20 08:44:53,5
212,betfair,Bit slow and have to delete and redownload about once a week as the deposit page consistently malfunctions. Decent bookies though and some of the promotions are quite good.,2020-08-04 15:42:12,3
213,betfair,"Its the best website out there, only downside is the theme of the website is bad and they dont show the scores of the match so you cant track progress, once they show that ill give it a 5.",2021-05-14 17:19:17,4

215,betfair,"Don't ever place a bet with BETFAIR before 8 am on the Sportsbook. They only give Best Odds Guaranteed after this time, i lost out on more than double my bet, by not being aware of this 8am ruling. But this ruling was never communicated to me in any way. They weren't interested in any thing to do the bet i had, when i highlighted the significance of the amount of money i had lost out on, which was over double.

217,betfair,"I have bet with betfair for years, in all honesty a few glitches and a few things have went wrong but to be expected by most websites. I have recently just had 2 season accumulator bets ( that have had cashout for 3 months now) SUSPENDED for the last 8 WEEKS ....took daily screenshots as proof etc as both bets are racing home for nearly ¬£40,000 . after numerous emails live chat etc and listening to every excuse under the sun after sending the relevant evidence.......

224,betfair,"Customer service is a joke. When requesting a price the traders simply ignore your request. In multi options markets they simply price multiple losing options so as to take 100% profit, in these cases the punter cannot even have the option of striking a winning bet. It is a tactic and borderline illegal. Example, if there are 9 horses in a race and they price only 8 and the 9th horse wins they keep 100% of the bets staked. Although my issue is in a different market entirely.",2020-10-08 06:21:25,2

227,betfair,This used to be a really good App but over the last few months its been very poor. It take a age sometimes for the scores to come through which really messes with cash out options ( i sometimes think they do it on purpose),2020-02-08 12:07:09,2
228,betfair,"it seems like a decent app but its very slow and takes so long to load up basic things, I'm withdrawing my funds and deleting until improvements in performance.",2019-05-12 08:31:24,2

230,betfair,Absolutely brilliant app and service. Customer support is very friendly and always assists with any issues that may arise.,2019-07-24 09:35:05,5
231,betfair,Customer service very slow. Took 4 hours to sort out why my account was suspended. Had to download documentation for identity when i had had an account for ages. I even had nearly ¬£500 in my account as well. Didn't get any of my bets on that day!,2021-01-01 10:00:16,1
232,betfair,"Average app. When it's works it good, but it rarely works well. Cash out is always suspended even if you only need one more bet to come in. Match stats very rarely work, so you can't monitor who's had shots on & off target.. So frustrating üò´",2021-05-11 14:49:02,3

235,betfair,My main betting app. Does all I need it to do. Cons. Payout takes to long. Holds your money so you can reverse the transaction for 1 day. To tempting for some to put it back in.,2020-05-24 05:18:58,5
236,betfair,Best betting app there is. Extremely interactive. Once had a customer service issue and it was resolved very quickly. Could not ask more,2019-12-14 07:29:30,5

248,betfair,Sometimes some games (especially in accas) are suspended for the duration of the game? this results in no option to cashout should that happen. This is very frustrating especially if most of the other games are in a positive resultüò° Having said that I di enjoy this app as opposed to the other leading betting sites.,2020-02-08 07:35:45,4

2932,betfair,"The roulette casino game (which I appreciate everyone looses money on) felt very riged. In fact the odds of some of these things happening in order were close roughly 1 in 900,000.

footy but it would be great if we got larger screen view pls. Generally 
phone staff are polite, odds competitive etc. What would be great is when 
check bets more info on winners/places rather than win/lose. Or add new 
sections? If you go to a bookmakers they pull up the info on the race",2018-08-11 01:24:04,4

Also had a member of staff *shannon* tell me that I was in the right. Still waiting on response and refund. !! As a customer who uses the services everyday this is a joke !! Also had a bet last month which was listed as lost when actually won bet totalled over ¬£400 Had to personal contact them to have it over turned !!,2018-09-02 06:51:20,3

3138,betfair,The cash out suspension for the whole 90 minutes is a nightmare...i understand that you guys lose the link to some games for whatever reason but so does bet365 but their cash out function is not affected. Also the ive noticed this is my 3rd year with the app and every christmas they do the daily sleigh ride challenge and in the 3 years i jave yet to win one single time. Bit pointless to have this function when its virtually impossible to win...edited to 1 star...cash out suspended again for the remainder of the games...shocking...going back to bet365...,2017-12-16 11:29:36,1
3139,betfair,"The main problem for me if that the cash out function is suspended for long duration when there is no issue in the actual game, just an issue with the so. Another problem is I have accumulators that don't show as cash out wagers even though every game wagered on is a cash out game. The this issue I have found if that since games are scored incorrectly by your app, for instance I recently looked at a game where your so displayed the score as something like 4-1 with very good odds on the winning team. I placed a wager on that team to win and proceeded to watch the live feed, it was then I noticed on the live feed that the other team was something like 2-0 up which was not the score advertised on the app and I subsequently lost the wager due to the false information. You really need to be fixing the issue. Already looking into being apps without these issues",2018-01-07 18:50:16,2
