0,ladbrokes,"Not a bad selection of bets. What I do find annoying is that if you win a bet you have to log out and then log back in to show winnings. Please just have a refresh button instead. I also know of a few friends who get the winning spin thing. I haven't had it in 3 years, hence why I choose skybet asy preferred betting platform. This one definitely lags behind many others.",2022-08-29 19:52:13,2
1,ladbrokes,"I never really rate apps but I felt like I had to for this one. Long story short, the app is very very bad. It takes a few minutes to actually load up (that's if it decides its going to load up as most of the time I get stuck on the loading screen) If I actually get into the app, usually it won't let me past the log in screen as it gets stuck there often and when I just want to cash out a bet, this can be very frustrating. The biggest issue is definitely the loading times, they're horrific",2020-03-12 14:57:04,1
2,ladbrokes,"App runs VERY slow, and constantly hangs up mid bet, sometimes I'm unsure if a bet has even been put on. And before you say it, I've already cleared the cache and data, restarted my device, and reinstalled the app. It makes no difference. Why should I have to comtact you with the details of the issues, when it's all written here? Sort it out or I'm going elsewhere.",2021-04-11 03:37:25,2
3,ladbrokes,"Virtually unusable since a pointless update. Ridiculously long time to open, if it does open at all, constantly asked to log in, then told my details are wrong or I'm not allowed to open it because of my location. (London)? Random navigation, the back button rarely takes you back to the previous page. All in all, was a great app, but due to some pointless tinkering it's now utter rubbish. We'll done everyone.",2019-11-25 07:00:31,1
4,ladbrokes,"Why is the app so slow? It's got so many good things going for it. Visually it's nice, the layouts easy to navigate and understand. You get all your freebie bets and any promotions. Everything works great. Except. It doesn't matter what device you're on, it doesn't matter if you use dial up, wireless broadband or your mobile data..... Its just sooooo slow. I've never, ever experienced a slower app. It could easily be a 5 star but its so slow that if I could give it only half a star I would.",2021-06-27 12:41:37,1
5,ladbrokes,Terrible app. Keeps closing down if you switch between apps and when it does you lose your being slip. Updated to 2 stars. Since the update the app was fine for about a week. Now I get ' cannot connect to server' or ' bet slip not available' around 6 times a week. Also on the new bet filter for horse betting it doesn't show thre odds (it used to). Have uninstalled/ installed twice with no change.,2019-11-11 04:18:52,2
6,ladbrokes,"So frustrating when trying to research and build your acca! If you're looking at another website and you change screens back to the Ladbroke app, it refreshes the coupon list you're on, always going back to the top. Very frustrating if you've worked most of your your way down the list. Also a few times, it crashes whilst refreshing so have to close the app and lose all of the bets you've put on your slip. Took about 6 attempts to build a 15 team acca!",2019-04-14 03:36:37,1
7,ladbrokes,Enjoying good odds and benefits but none of the casino games work (I just got through to a jackpot and it crashed). It took me a month to be able to access the free spins despite contacting customer service. Have had multiple problems with 5 aside. Have also had problems logging in when it doesn't accept my password. All this on 3 different devices and browsers. The app needs a lot of work.,2020-12-23 05:26:15,1
8,ladbrokes,"Awful. It doesn't work if I'm on home WiFi, is painfully slow to respond (if it doesn't freeze and doesn't respond at all). I've used programs on a ZX81 which are more user friendly. Why I've tolerated it for so long is anyone's guess. But definitely when my latest lot of credits get used I will leave for another betting app which can't possibly be worse.",2021-10-12 16:46:14,1
9,ladbrokes,"Had enough of this now. Put up with it for the last two years, so slow, repeated freezing. Really really REALLY BAD APP. moving to someone else for this season. Contacted by Ladbrokes to say contact them about this. What is the point? I have stated here the issues. To see the issues, try the virgin app. Not for betting value etc, just for speed and functionality . Compare the two. That should explain it for you.",2021-10-29 03:50:37,1
10,ladbrokes,"The app is really slow. Sometimes even crashes whilst using a broadband connection. Constantly freezes and that makes the whole experience awful. It's a shame because the odd boost and fast withdrawal are a plus, however the whole app experience is bad in my opinion. Also takes some time for the balance to be updated tho the bet was settled. And your response is to try and log out and reinstall the app? Even on a new device and WiFi the app is appalling.",2021-04-21 17:38:05,1
11,ladbrokes,May be it's me but this app is worthy of a score of 70 out of 100. We should talk about the good things really it easy to navigate it has a quick response. and holds up to most of their competitors . on the other hand unfortunately I find it irritating when it freezes when watching virtual live football. and more so when your going through the cards betting show and as you pick the next race or later it suddenly goes back to the first. race. the only ways is reload the app. .,2019-04-30 10:04:03,4
12,ladbrokes,"Dreadful app. In the month I've used it, there have been ""technical issues"" which have suspended all games stopping me from cashing out and having to use other sources to check scores. Both times I've contacted them and its been well after the final whistle and all they can say is ""sorry for the inconvenience"". Both times this has happened its been on a Saturday afternoon, possibly the busiest time in the UK for betting on football. Would not recommend.",2020-11-07 12:13:21,1
13,ladbrokes,"This is a very poor app. üëéüèª I have been using it with an S10 on the latest software. It crashed every time I used it and when it didn't crash it lagged heavily. completely unusable. Persevered for a week. The only thing going for it is 'odds boosting', sync with RP and decimalisation of odds. It made me remember why I deleted it a year ago. Poor quality - Stick to SkyBet.",2019-08-07 12:53:12,2
14,ladbrokes,"The app freezes up and I miss the opportunity to get my bet on. The video is very poor, streaming of the video is hard to obtain, freezes and breaks up to an extent where the race cannot be watched and if a total waste of time. Frequently the video will not change to landscape view. overall very poor.",2019-04-15 09:39:34,1
15,ladbrokes,The betting features of this App are great I love the 5 a-side!! Am that being said the app is always running very slow & doesn't update in time with the games being played!! Also if you make a mistake with an accidental bet you cannot cancel the bet!! Needs a lot of improvements.... I'm seriously considering uninstalling the app and going with one of the other big betting sites. Be wary when you download.,2021-05-11 13:29:42,1
16,ladbrokes,Seems to have developed a blip. App is running very slow and does not interact with the keyboard. Painfully slow and can't even log in properly . This has been the same for a good 6 weeks now. I have reinstalled and cleared all app data and cache as well as all browsers In case that's all related. Stll the same. It's not my phone all other apps are fine. I'm running Android 8.0 and version 6.3.0. Thanks,2020-06-20 10:16:51,1
17,ladbrokes,"App is very glitchy at the minute. When it works, it works well, when it's glitchy, it's a pain in the rear to say the least. Wont let you click back, and when it does, it keeps refreshing to the deposit funds page (I currently have ¬£10 in there so no need to top it up). To get any real use out of it, I need to log out and back in, and it takes ages to do so, or more often I just give up. I'll give the app a chance for updates but am thinking of returning to Paddy Power.",2019-12-30 07:31:53,3
18,ladbrokes,"its an ok app but does crash a lot especially when using the games , regularly loses connection and freezes so can be a pain , it is a well laid out app though and is easy to navigate to your desired bet ( if it doesnt crash ). ive not experienced any issues with depositing or withdrawing either so it is just the connection issues letting it down.",2019-02-14 06:42:10,2
19,ladbrokes,"Worst betting app out there. Everytime i go onto this app to play some games it just lags or crashes on you litreally the worst. You go to your inbox and it's like ""click here to recive a free ¬£5 bonus on us"" and when you do click on it and try and play one of the ""eligible"" games it's like it's trying to make it as hard as possible to play either freezing or crashing it's the same with real money too would give it 0* if i could.",2022-07-05 11:46:39,1
20,ladbrokes,"Good app but there's a bug and something I don't like. The bug is that when you close the app down and leave it running in the background, when you go to go back on the app from recently used apps it freezes and you have to restart the app. On football acca section, you only get todays and tomorrows fixtures, it would be good if you had daily fixtures for the full week like on William Hill app. Using Galaxy S9+. Thanks, Tony.",2019-06-23 07:15:08,4
21,ladbrokes,"it is just a ok app to use, it does what you want but not very advance app. for example if i want to refresh the page i have to close and open the app which is annoying. it has great feature for horse racing such as accumulator and top three finish which is great tool to use istead of either way betting. please add feature such as horse performance in previous 5 races in horse detail. also add prevous day results for UK horse racing. please only display next races for UK only",2019-03-02 02:57:46,3
22,ladbrokes,The app is great and easy to follow. My only problem is the 1-2-free football correct scores feature as it doesn't take you through to the predictions page when you click on it for some reason. Maybe it's me or maybe it's an issue that needs addressing. Otherwise. A great app,2019-09-28 10:22:19,4
23,ladbrokes,This app is actually getting worse to use! Not only is it still the slowest ever app created (congratulations on that achievement) but now it's taken to losing the contents of the bet slip. The only fix is to wipe the storage clean but that means re-entering all of your details to get back in. Time to move onto a company that doesn't treat it's customers like they're an inconvenience.,2021-01-30 05:34:24,1
24,ladbrokes,"Half the time the app fails to load due to the latest update. The other half of the time it doesn't let me on due to ""location restrictions"" despite me being in home, on wifi, and oh, also IN THE UK. Very annoying, may just switch full time to PP which is a shame, and 1-2-Free is great, and I'm always getting free ¬£1 bets. Sort it out Ladbrokes!!",2019-11-04 16:49:35,2
25,ladbrokes,"Needs serious improvements, sluggish, slow, pressing a button it takes a good 3-4 seconds before it does it then faced with a 2-3 second blank screen while it loads... Once loaded and you go to press something it loads pictures then you end up accidentally pressing them... All round a terrible terrible app from a huge company... Expected them to keep up with rivals but falled so far off... Almost impossible to use..",2021-05-01 06:30:18,1
26,ladbrokes,App is still full of bugs. It magically took over ¬£30 because for some reason it decided to change the race to susp (suspended). There is barely any info of what it is what it does. If you bet take a screenshot of every damn receipt and make sure you know the bet info because you wont be able to recover you money otherwise. App is crashing and loading slow. Logs me out every I often. When I registered I asked for them to store my user name and password yet I still have to put it in manually.,2020-04-26 00:16:11,1
27,ladbrokes,Worst betting app I have used. Thought it was maybe my device had the issue but no. The app is so slow and unresponsive. Have missed bets and almost made the wrong stake because of the slow nature and lag that can take place when inputting a deposit/stake. Serious work needs to be done to the app to make it run better. Actually have to use skybet app to make my selections and then input them into ladbrokes as its 10 times faster than trying to use your app for picking my selections.,2021-04-17 07:00:53,2
28,ladbrokes,"Ladbrokes is a fantastic betting firm, providing great offers and odds for various sports. Unfortunately, this app keeps freezing and crashing, I'd say a good 10 times a day, resulting in an extremely frustrating experience. One time I tried to deposit ¬£5, but the app crashed and when I reopened it, it had deposited ¬£10!",2019-09-09 13:39:43,2
29,ladbrokes,"A complete disaster, does not work properly, this is not an app, it's a mess. Goes on in the background when closed the animated graphics within the app(mess) interfere with the loading and smooth operation of the app, and it even freezes my phone or other apps that I have going, and the general problems that Ladbrokes are having with their IT networks mean that it's offline frequently, so unable to cash out of bets if I wish, use with caution, I only use if the odds are substantially higher and I won't be cashing out.....usless",2018-09-24 04:28:03,1
30,ladbrokes,"Very slow and buggy, always crashing and now I can't even log in because it take so long and stops responding. Fingerprint technology has stopped to work. So disappointed in the app. You would think that a big company like this will invest in making the app better as more and more people prefer betting on mobile phones. You will definitely lose more customers than you gain in the long term if you don't improve this rubbish! Uninstalled!",2020-07-18 05:16:34,1
31,ladbrokes,This is THE most annoying experience I have ever encountered. Ladbrokes you really are quite sad! Use bet 365. Its 10 times better. Why dont you review it yourselves. You would then see that this terribly unstable app is frustrating and very very poor. It is impossible to read the horses. The info keeps going off and now keeps going back to the first race. This app always breaks down on a Saturday afternoon. Not so long back you seemed to have improved the football with more stats etc. No longer.,2018-12-21 23:52:02,1
32,ladbrokes,"I really love Ladbrokes. I love the odds-boost feature, and the daily chance to win free bets or chances at a variety of games. It's also one of the few betting apps which include MMA (when they don't accidentally miss a card). My only issues are some of the games are lacking information, so sometimes its not clear what you're supposed to do. Also the app frequently crashes, and is a bit slow. I'd say even with these issues, however, Ladbrokes is the best betting app available.",2022-07-14 10:08:21,4
33,ladbrokes,"The UI was magnificent until they played around with the defaults for a bit then put them back to how they were. It was that well laid out I would automatically put on a bet without religiously having to double check everything, silly I know but I had felt comfortable with the app. Then the problems started can't display try again. The ridiculous lengthy upload of a page or non. I like to bet once in a while hence I never really bothered putting up a review but to be honest this app needs help.",2022-03-05 07:29:15,1
34,ladbrokes,"Lack of patience on my side led to a ""bad"" review, previously, but now that all that's behind us I have no problem giving 5 stars. Navigation and graphics are great and ""free to play"" options are appreciated. Cash outs are really fast (4 hours max) and the 1-2-Free & 5-A-Side add a nice bit of interest with the Football. Top notch app and worth a look if you haven't checked it out before...",2022-11-13 13:39:05,5
35,ladbrokes,"Recently I've been having trouble trying to load some games, it comes up as an error and to retry which I've done loads and followed all the steps from the team on messenger app. They keep repeating same things like uninstall the app an check for updates. They say they can see a stuck game on my account and apparently they've sorted this, yet I'm still having the same trouble, so they've made me follow all the steps again and again. They have said again there is stuck game. Bad customer support.",2022-12-14 18:20:33,1

37,ladbrokes,"Very easy to use app, with great offers for new customers. The app runs very smoothly and has many bets which are exciting to have a look at.

Overall 5 stars, great app, runs smoothly, plenty of betting options and quick withdrawal.",2022-10-27 07:37:20,5
38,ladbrokes,"I had put a negative review as I was on a losing streak with the slots, and whilst I haven't got anywhere near the money I have put in it has gave me some nice wins and free games are sometimes profitable as well which was a surprise when I won over ¬£50 when I was skint. So whilst I don't recommend playing the slots you do get some decent wins sometimes as well.",2022-12-02 21:17:54,5
39,ladbrokes,"After taking a break from sports betting, I reinstalled this app today. Same! issues as before and it's about 2 years since I first got the app. Always! problem with logging in and staying logged in. One would want the patience of a saint! for this app. I doubt I'll be keeping it much longer unless miraculously! the issues get fixed.

After resetting app joined same game 43 spins in I get free spins and got 0 win lines on 25 free spins. Another 150 spins go by with 3 wins and no free spins. So they are not random.

41,ladbrokes,"I would put zero stars if I could. Awful! Log in details won't work, says my username is wrong when it isn't. Try to reset password which is not helpful as you need to type in your username which I know is right as I have an email from Ladbrokes with my username on.

Waste of time!",2022-10-31 10:26:51,1
42,ladbrokes,This has turned into one of the worst betting apps available. It has always been impossible to place bets just before a race starting but for the last few days pages don't open blaming my connection which just so happens to work for every other app except for Ladbroke's sister company that has exactly the same problem.,2022-10-22 03:21:26,1

It's not my Internet, its not my device! The website is so slow , my guess is its because of the amount of users logged in at any one time. Which would imply that ladbrokes either don't have enough servers , or the servers are out dated.",2023-01-22 05:31:54,1
81,ladbrokes,"The app is a joke. It repeatedly logs me out, then freezes when trying to log back in. On the rare occasions when I do manage to log back in, as soon as I click on a specific section, it logs me out again. To complete the joke, Ladbrokes then ask me if I want to log in via my fingerprint. If you can't competently process my login details, then I'm certainly not going to trust you with my fingerprint! To clarify, this review applies just to the app. The Ladbrokes website works fine.",2020-04-17 03:05:53,1
82,ladbrokes,App is appalling. Sort it out.... is very slow to respond and constantly freezes . More often I end up closing it and using a different betting app. That being said Ladbrooks do offer a number of benefits and that is the reason I don't just leave it.

On reload it continues and respins the last played spin (i.e. the spin that crashed it)and guess what? that makes it crash again, but this time instead of telling me I'm disconnected it informs me the game has encountered an error please reload. So on reloading, the cycle repeats so can't collect win or even play the slot",2019-03-23 15:58:05,2
84,ladbrokes,"Not sure about anyone else but I find this app nearly impossible to log in to. Tried using the fingerprint sensor, it leaves the loading box in the middle of the screen then constantly asks for me to log in even though i am already logged in?!!

Sometimes not all leagues, (foreign), are available for football betting.",2019-04-05 05:05:11,4

88,ladbrokes,Absolutely terrible. The worst betting app out there. Whoever made this app needs sacking. It ms constantly lagging. Tagging up to 5 mins sometimes to load a page. It's doesn't play live stream properly so u most often miss races etc. It's cone to a point where I will o ly use this app now if I get a free bet.

Terrible app, the only reason I use it because ladbrokes is the only betting shop left in my town now. Otherwise I'd use any other app. They do have live help but that slows your phone down even more and I had to close the app many times just to get back into the live help conversation. The live help did help me though I will add.",2022-03-07 10:47:15,1

I have cleared cache/data uninstalled and started again numerous times but still the same.I also find it frustrating that you can't view your open bets whilst on the gaming page like the other.You have to leave the game come out of casino to go back to the sports page to view them.Shame as has the potential to be one of the best betting apps but the performance of late has seen me using different apps,2021-08-29 18:56:39,2
104,ladbrokes,New update is terrible. The app looks better but is now slower than ever and unresponsive at times. Some items just refuse to accept being clicked on. There is also a log in bug that seems to also be affecting other users in which the app claims the password entered is incorrect.

Be warned - but if you can put up with that, good luck!",2021-09-03 20:26:06,4
108,ladbrokes,Awful. Ladbrokes have the knack of making their app progressively worse. It's slow and unresponsive. Login details either aren't recognised or have to be reentered. I'm tempted to use an alternative site where these problems don't exist. Also co nstantly bombarded by popups for roulette etc. Really annoying.

Still takes a while to load and phone wants to stop it because it stays active when you move of it to look at something else.

Every Saturday when the league games are on you can never get on them Ladbrokes is happy to take your money and not allow you to even watch or control your bets because the whole system goes down.

122,ladbrokes,I've no problem with Ladbrokes as a betting service however this app is just appalling. On a high-end smartphone this app still runs as if I'm using an unoptimized android phone from 2011. You seriously need to consider investing in a new app which actually feels slick and more alive. I'm at the point where I'd rather use the desktop site on the Chrome App on mobile instead of navigating this slow clunky app,2021-01-03 16:41:10,1
123,ladbrokes,"Not good. App very slow at log in and to navigate between pages. You would think for the size of the bookmaker they would have a better app than this. Some of the offers with free bets and odds are great, but you are frustrated trying to place them.",2020-07-04 06:00:00,2

Very disappointed with the experience from ladbrookes I will search for a new betting platform no other can be as bad as this,2020-10-31 11:55:39,1
126,ladbrokes,It's the worst upgrade yet. Why can't you do things for the better rather than worst. Its sooo frustrated. Been a Ladbrokes customer for many years .

223,ladbrokes,DO NOT use any cash-out feature. I had a ¬£2000 Acca Insurance football bet and with 2 mins left 4 teams were winning so I went to cash-out. Suddenly they switched four active games to SUSPENDED to block the cash-out feature & remained that way until the final whistle. The pay-out should have been hundreds but they said that their 'systems' can make the cash-out facility 'unavailable-at-any-time'. In other words NO-ONE has control over their bet even though Ladbrokes says you are in control.,2020-01-11 13:35:03,1

They have saved me money as I would've lost them. But i feel like i am missing out on the fun of betting. In play betting regularly fails to put the bets on.

232,ladbrokes,Horrible app. It's slow and the betting is suspended much more than other apps. They sent me a survey to complete for ¬£5 in free bets but when I answered the first half dozen questions they said I wasn't suitable. I would avoid this company and app. There is much better more fun apps to use. I gave one star only because you can't give zero. Update. Still as bad as ever,2022-08-06 08:02:43,1

Keep getting a pop up saying I've played so many minutes and press play on but doesn't actually let you play on it just pops back up and doesn't let me spin at all. So stick your free spins I'm done with this app. it's the slowest of the betting apps I use and suspends and lot of my footy acca's for no reason at all just so I can' cash out.

255,ladbrokes,"Ridiculous. Cheltenham week and unable to login to the app. The biggest insult is being told by Live Help that there isn't an issue. Does nobody from Ladbrokes read the reviews on here? As I'm clearly not alone. No point having the fab Odds Boosts etc if I can't access them. The only way I can get into the app is to add a selection to the betslip for a few pennies and login through there, which then places the bet, so basically I have to pay to get in. Madness.

302,ladbrokes,Not much point of this app when you cant bet or look at your bets most of the time so the cash out option is pointless it comes up that there is a connection problem with my internet when I am working off my wifi so there is clearly not!very disappointed could be a great app,2020-10-17 11:59:34,1

Then they froze my winnings and blamed my bank, even though i proved it wasnt banks fault they still kept my winnings so i quit and closed account. Tried Ladbrokes... WHAT A DIFFERENCE !! , menus much easier to navigate, odds much more generous. And overall just a lot more fun, easy to use and an overall slickness. Very happy i moved :)",2020-11-06 15:48:55,5

309,ladbrokes,Joke of a app. Notifications are pointless as there none one minute then is loads in the in box and some will be out of date.

671,ladbrokes,Why does it need location on when on wifi? I have to state this again. The developers are very bad at their job and it shows. They have absolutely no idea how a proper app should function. You would think a company like ladbrokes would hire professionals,2019-04-21 10:03:04,1

4709,ladbrokes,"After update, it's even worse than before? Why have you changed the jockey and trainer positions on the meetings page? What does this achieve except to confuse people further? Still freezing. Still can't place a lucky bet the evening before without it turning a lucky bet to a patent bet? 2011 was the best Ladbrokes. Don't fix what's not broken. Designers trying to justify their payroll? How can we improve our site? Oh let's change the jockey and trainer positions around, wow what a great idea not",2019-10-24 22:30:01,1

5221,ladbrokes,.. .....,2019-03-28 02:37:45,4
5222,ladbrokes,Moves onto the next race and just as you start to read the form it automatically flicks back to the first race you look at. Very often can't load in the middle of racing if you want to place a bet. Has frozen a few times.... Everytime I go into it I have to close a link telling me I have games to play. Very frustrating. My phone is android.... Maybe others have had a better experience,2019-01-05 09:19:49,2
5223,ladbrokes,App works well and quickly. I like how the free bets I get credited show in the box at the top of the screen where my account is. Layout is clean and navigation is some to work through to the areas I visit most. I have noticed occasionally that the score updates are not applied - recently a score changed three times and the app never showed that the time had moved on in the games from around the 20th minute. Bet won but it could have been an issue if I had been unable to cash out... More recently I am finding the app will not refresh the page showing my bets. If I miss a cashout I would be very annoyed. Tried on 2 very modern phones but it happens on both so must be a Ladbrokes programme error.,2018-12-12 10:41:15,4
5224,ladbrokes,terrible.. most slots if crashed even when bonus has just started usually reload with your win amount. even though you don't select a box be it. just pre programmed robbery. last time for me.,2019-01-01 13:32:24,1
5225,ladbrokes,"Win notifications do not work. App doesnt feel polished enough. just a web wrapper. every time you open the app or open back up when minimised, it keeps trying to take you to their gaming site!! please remove this every time i open this up!",2019-01-05 09:12:46,2
5226,ladbrokes,1 star for that you can place bets but that's it ! odds are way off and virtual football shocking put 8 treble's on over 5 hours every one got to last game and lost every time on the last couple of minutes the under dog would win going to change to another betting site,2018-12-31 04:19:56,1
5227,ladbrokes,"Having to switch funds between sports and games is ludicrous in this day and age, but otherwise a 5 star site.",2019-02-16 08:40:12,4
5228,ladbrokes,Works fine with a convenient useable interface and the daily boosts and bonuses/money back as free bets are handy.,2018-11-11 05:58:59,5
5229,ladbrokes,The app closes and freezing at times when playing slots. Unpredictable!,2019-01-27 11:57:43,3

5233,ladbrokes,you guys are ridiculously bad show a banner about a new game click the x button and takes you to it anyway go bet on paddypower or williamhill dont use coral ladbrokes as they are same company,2019-02-18 07:16:06,2

5530,ladbrokes,Did a small football bet both teams to score did not do any in play selections. Went back to see what times for kick off to see my selections well into the second half was only away about half an hour. Time of get clearly shows time I did get and there's no in play selection on it how could this happen not the 1st time,2018-09-09 13:29:38,2
5531,ladbrokes,"All of your software is the worst around, I don't know how you do business. Your poker kicks me off, happens on PC too.. The casino app doesn't work, this app doesn't work, your promotions are better for non VIP members. Your slots never pay, I've played them lots and they are predictable, and tight as I've seen. I don't know who your tech guys are, but I'm guessing you just have a bunch of chimpanzees programming for you. With so many people preferring to use internet to place bets over the highstreet shop you'd think you'd fix this. You must have lost so many customers to more functional apps",2018-09-11 17:43:22,1
5532,ladbrokes,"Has paid out on a win. Never an issue. However, Reason 3 stars is because this app is suddenly activating itself and running in the background. Keeps doing this recently even though turn of permissions.",2018-09-11 18:25:56,3
5533,ladbrokes,"Costs me a bloody fortune, but on the odd occasion that I win they pay me out without any hassle.",2018-09-10 10:09:21,4
5534,ladbrokes,Another Saturday another app crash! 10 minutes before the games end and people want to cash out or last minute bets... Not with ladbrokes. As soon as cash is gone app is being deleted,2018-09-29 12:00:24,4
5535,ladbrokes,Been terrible recently. No in play options and no refund on my bet. Will not be using this company again,2018-09-09 14:02:08,1
5536,ladbrokes,"Like many other reviews I don't like the mandatory location setting to be on, but also the notifications that come up showing offers, don't link to the bet they apply to, just endless spinning of the 'loading' screen. I'm uninstalling until this improves.",2018-09-11 15:11:18,2
5537,ladbrokes,"Since the last update, I can no longer use it without enabling location services. I will not allow location services. I think you don't need to know where I am when I'm using the app. Should I delete the app?",2018-09-07 05:46:15,1
5538,ladbrokes,"Forever needs reloading. Always crashing, terrible site",2018-09-23 09:37:42,2

5953,ladbrokes,"The interface of the app is very good and responsive. In terms of football betting, the list of matches available  to place a bet on is not so comprehensive as say, Sky bet or Bet 365.  Also there seems to be the odd connection issue now and again which does hamper the betting experience. I hope that Ladbrokes fix this issue soon.",2018-03-02 09:22:17,3
5954,ladbrokes,"The worse bookies in terms of customer service.

5955,ladbrokes,Used to work fine but now crashes continuously. Keeps saying it needs and update but is up to date. Hopeless hopeless app took me 10 minutes and 5 attempts to put on an accumulator this morning as it kept crashing. Also friend using different companies seem  to get a better array of choices on their bets. Also get tonnes of unwanted notifications that I either can't read or say null.,2018-03-17 06:31:00,1
5956,ladbrokes,Didn't get no welcome bonus and no free bets as the lady said in store when I went to get a grid card. It seems to not want to update your balance when you win bets.. and always crashes so you have to keep restarting the app. Sky bet app is alot better,2018-02-20 14:47:21,2
5957,ladbrokes,Didn't get my sign up f50 promo free bet wouldn't let me enter any promo code .. They did give me a pathetic 1 pound virtual free bet lol.

trying to deposit funds and just kept taking me to the home screen as

as I'm placing the bet. Then it's too late as my race has already gone off.",2018-04-27 05:35:13,4

5971,ladbrokes,"The app and site is as good as any bookmaker, the trouble with Ladbrokes is they don't value their customers, no free bets on Mondays or ludicrous staking needed for VIP status, if you're a recreational punter that doesn't spend thousands use skybet, pp or hills they treat their customers with respect.

6367,ladbrokes,"Be aware as long as you just play and lose they don't care about their customers. As soon as you win and want to withdraw your money your account will be blocked within a minute and they want your driving licence, passport etc because suddenly they worried someone commited identity fraud and winning in your name and want to put money into your account. No reply from them when you send the required documents. Still waiting.",2017-12-09 03:17:24,1
6368,ladbrokes,"I enjoy every minute of my betting experience on the Ladbrokes app. It would be nice to have more live play but I also understand this might be down to contractual reasons. Having free bets is also a bonus as it's gives you a second chance of a return, of which has paid off on a few occasions.",2017-12-27 13:01:50,5
6369,ladbrokes,"One of my favorite betting apps. Too bad you can't see scores after game on your betslips, have to use other apps to check them. And sometimes it's hard to bet on live games because the odds are changing every second. But overall still better than other apps and easy to understand.",2017-12-05 02:53:56,4
6370,ladbrokes,"Horrific app, just like their website. Hopeless if you expect a cash out ( which they offer and withdraw when it suits them ) . Man city beat stoke 3 0 on saturday according to a check of my settled bets on tuesday. Final  score 7 - 2 . Customer service a joke. Throw your money away before downloading this app. Dont let the concerned comments fool you. Theyve been like this for months.EXACTLY the same problems on their website. There will be no "" further issues "" with Ladbrokes. You had months to correct complaints. Using other company.",2017-11-21 15:02:47,1
6371,ladbrokes,"Great App, the only thing I find annoying is that I have to log out and log back in to refresh my balance. I think the app should have a balance refresh button.  Asp I bet on slot of foreign games on first half goals but never the option to cash out. Maybe you could look at making that an option. Other than that I'm happy",2018-01-07 18:47:21,5
6372,ladbrokes,"Pointlessly spoke to four people on chat yesterday after making my first withdrawal who all assured me I have verified my ID and that there would be no hiccups if I call in store to collect (app says just take username and PWD in to a branch). I arrived at the store for them to tell me you need a grid card and the website is out of date. Oh, and my ID wasn't verified so I couldn't collect it. Decent app, mediocre (at best) customer service tied to it - stick to PP.",2017-12-17 06:31:23,1
6373,ladbrokes,"The worst betting app I've ever used. And I've used them all.  Sure it might have a few nice feature. But that sacrifices speed, it is the slowest app I've used since the iPhone 3gs  As well as it being slow it has serious security flaws.   When I first signed up it told me my password was wrong. So I tried to reset my password but i didn't get an email for a whole day. So I tried to resend the email, still no luck. So then I presumed it had failed when creating the account.   So I proceeded to create another account but my username was taken and my mobile number, however I could use my email again. Very strange. Then it told me my password was wrong again. Hmm  I then pressed the back button on Google chrome app and boom it logged me in. Very strange indeed. I then deposit money and try to put a bet on. Logged me out after taking money.  So I ring up and they take off one of the accounts and manually reset my password. Everything is working but I didn't get my promotional free bets. So I contact them and they said ""oh yeah they didn't work blah blah. I'll put them on tomorrow.""  I check every day still no free bets. Then I contact them again. This time the chat disconnected me so I had to type it all out again. So I started typing this big essay about how bad it has been. Then the guy said you are taking too long and disconnected me again.   Then finally I managed to explain to someone and he just said you have already had your promotional free bets and told me there was nothing he could do.  Wow.",2018-01-22 15:15:19,1
6374,ladbrokes,"Not had this app long,but so far it has been pretty user friendly.Has good updates on how your multiple bet are doing , especially football coupons. Definitely better than others I've used which can be slow and awkward to navigate.",2018-01-06 12:05:22,4
6375,ladbrokes,"Without doubt, the worst betting company in the world. Economical with the truth. Diverting problems. I can only assume the website was built on a commadore Amiga or spectrum 128 k......Two things you won't get from here is your money or time wasted.",2018-01-02 16:37:07,1
6376,ladbrokes,Every time I have a winning accumulator it seems strange Ladbrokes stall in offering me a cash out. I have lost out on a number of bets now because the cash out is suspended. I ha e raised this with the contact us option but been ignored every time,2017-12-07 10:43:32,2
6377,ladbrokes,Shame there's no cash out on first half goals. Most other apps do. Apart from that easy to use and well layed out,2018-01-24 12:10:46,5

6389,ladbrokes,Could be given back a little more when depositing large amounts of money over time as a loyalty scheme. Free bets based on how much you have spent say 5%-10% back would be very reasonable.  Thanks long term customer.,2017-12-13 15:58:28,5

6393,ladbrokes,Can't use it on holiday abroad to check my bets placed before I left UK because it demands access to satellite receiver. I even tried installing a UK proxy server but that didn't help. Haven't received any help and will probably switch to another bookmaker.,2017-12-23 18:41:02,1

6620,ladbrokes,"Very poor app. Constant glitches and incorrect scores. Also, they pull out matches just so you can't cash out. Halftime/fulltime bets especially where you have a team to lead at halftime but lose at fulltime odds of 20/1 or higher usually and if it is still on at halftime that match will have all bets suspended and the cashout will be suspended also.

6621,ladbrokes,Terrible app I have tried numerous times to give them my address and age verification and they have done nothing about it and now they have my personal information and ‚Ç¨10 deposit. Anyone thinking of downloading this app don't. I have given them numerous times to sort this out. I wish there was a rating for customer service it would be zero. If ladbrokes sees this keep the ‚Ç¨10 because I will never spend a cent in any ladbrokes ever again and I will inform people who ask me about ladbrokes about my experience.,2017-11-04 04:17:18,1

Even with the one team insurance thing you have going on I still use sky. Study their app a bit and learn A LOT of things on how to make betting easy and fast",2017-08-27 20:59:21,2
6623,ladbrokes,"The app is awful, half the scores on accas don't update  (like games haven't kicked off) cash out always suspended I assume because of games that don't update after 54min of play! Only ever used lads app but this update is S#!T and obviously hasn't been tested before roll out, and faults haven't been addressed time to move account.",2017-08-19 11:16:43,1
6624,ladbrokes,"Awful app that has just cost me money!!!! Had 7 team Acca on with 6 teams winning and 1 drawing. I wanted to cash out but cash out option was not working and had not been working for over an hour!!! Thanks Ladbrokes. Stay clear of this app!!!  Have used Ladbrokes app have 2 years and only time cash out didn't work was last 5/10mins of games, it stopped working for over an hour. Agent told me there was a technical issue and Ladbrokes refused to do anything about it and couldn't care less. Account closed and taking business elsewhere!! As I said stay clear of this app!!!",2017-10-03 10:37:57,1
6625,ladbrokes,Account still froze after 5 days and no response from customer care. Pass this on if you want not expecting any response..After getting in touch with customer care all issues concerning the app and my account were sorted with In 24hrs app is working 100% very happy with Ladbrokes  Thanks Richard,2017-08-31 05:10:28,5
6626,ladbrokes,"Been using Ladbrokes for years. But is getting so bad I will be closing my account and switching to a more reliable bookmaker. I put a football accumulator on today, everything is fine for a while, then near full time it doesn't even show the scores. SHOCKING. Would give it 0 stars if I could.",2017-09-30 11:52:00,1
6627,ladbrokes,"DO NOT TRUST LADBROKES. 1st they changed the rules on a special offer bet because they thought the team wouldn't win. So instead of giving me 33-1 (as advertised) they changed it to ¬£20 free bet and then totally denied this offer was on. 2nd I placed an each way bet on a horse that finished 2nd and didn't get paid out, spoke to customer services and they say an each way bet has to finish 1st.  They will say anything not to pay out, do not use these criminals who make there own rules.",2017-09-28 09:31:03,1
6628,ladbrokes,The app as a whole is great apart from when your going through my bets. I'd laid 6 bets on the football on a Saturday spending best part of  ¬£30 and as I kept checking the cash out facility was constantly suspended. Not good in my opinion. Other than that a great app.,2017-10-01 03:41:07,4
6629,ladbrokes,This app is terrible. Always crashing. Can't gain access to check once games are nearly over. Never gives out cash outs when only awaiting one team to win. Changing betting app hoping to get my rewards i deserve,2017-09-02 12:00:49,1
6630,ladbrokes,"Awful app. Should have know it was going to be bad when you couldn't download it normally from the playstore, when all their competitors were freely available there. Also got the constant ""update available"" message when there doesn't appear to be one.  After not using during the summer, tried to use it today and it won't launch, I get the ""update available"" bs message that links me to the playstore, where I can either open the app or uninstall it, if I click open it looks me back round to the same ""update available"" msg. I'll probably get the ""sorry to hear... blah..blah..please contact our support team"" - but I can't be bothered, pretty embarrassing that in this day and age a company like Ladbrokes can't hire app developers qualified enough to sort these issues out.",2017-08-12 06:02:04,1
6631,ladbrokes,"The worst betting app ever, no contest.   The layout of the football markets is dreadful and there are not all games on there.  You'd think you could live chat for assistance but don't be fooled. Despite being persuaded to do so, there is actually no live chat!",2017-10-01 10:36:16,1
6632,ladbrokes,"Apparently half the games havnt kicked off yet at 3.45 lol so glitchy and freezes every 5 minutes, cashout stays suspended pretty much from the 60th minute onwards! Definitely some trading laws being broken here",2017-09-30 10:39:42,1
6633,ladbrokes,"So buggy, crashes, doesn't update quick enough cash out slow too. Awful. It's now 15.35 and none of the 3 o'clock games are showing in my ACCA as kicked off, cost me me cash outs, site is the same, absolute joke, not using Laddies anymore sadly",2017-10-14 10:37:32,1
6634,ladbrokes,"Terribly disappointed by the app and Ladbrokes in general. Was on a 39 pound cash out so I though ""why not"" I hit the cash out button, the app didn't respond. Tried again on 38 pounds but again  no response. After speaking to customer service they said there was a bug issue and had the right to withdraw any cash outs. A little convenient don't you think??",2017-10-28 06:06:22,1
6635,ladbrokes,"Very hard to check how your bets are doing, unlike other sites. There should be a facility on your bet that shows where your selections have finished on your ongoing bet slip.",2017-09-26 14:53:37,3
6636,ladbrokes,"Why have you changed the football coupon to be sorted alphabetically, this is terrible it needs to by league and early kickoff as previously.  In response to your reply. NO why don't you do it I have given you the details of the problem above.",2017-08-21 12:52:41,2
6637,ladbrokes,"Terrible betting app, best to avoid Ladbrokes. Football scores do not update in real time. Matches finish without scores being confirmed, therefore meaning cashout is unavailable, making the cashout option invalid as matches are always suspended.  Will be moving to Sky Bet, much better service and actually updates with LIVE information unlike Ladbrokes.",2017-09-30 11:47:32,1
6638,ladbrokes,"Terrible app. Balances take an age to update, cash outs never enabled, inplay score don't update. Woeful functionality",2017-09-30 12:38:55,2
6639,ladbrokes,"Poor app. Terrible display. Not a patch on Sky bet. Info difficult to read, navigating round the various markets is garbage. Deleting it and off back to SB.",2017-10-08 05:16:28,1
6640,ladbrokes,Good app.but it keeps saying that I need to update an there is none available.also it logs out to quickly if I switch page.it logs out straight away an it's really frustrating when I'm looking at the horse racing form at the last minute then I miss the race because I have to log in again,2017-08-22 10:24:58,3

6650,ladbrokes,The app is rubbish.  I will use a different bookies from now on.. scores do not update and other games there is ... v .... and the games been kicked off an hour and it's 3-0 ... cash out is useless as it just says suspended all the time... the whole thing is awful!!... take a look at the Betfair app and get some ideas off that.

6654,ladbrokes,Why does this new app need my location? It seems a few updated apps like Super 6 and Sky Fantasy Football won't let me log in unless I have turned on my location....and basically use more battery life??? Pain in the 'arris and never needed to before.. ..why now?,2017-08-14 22:23:39,3
6655,ladbrokes,Does the job. But try and get your winnings. That's a whole new gamble in its self. Took 5 days the first time and when you thought it would be easier the second time around... No it's not. I will possibly be trying out another site soon,2017-09-30 07:18:08,3
