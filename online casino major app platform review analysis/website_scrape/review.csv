2023-02-01,"I’m being bombarded with emails from this incompetent organisation! I have continually ‘unsubscribed’ but still the emails come…two or three per day!!I had an email from Justin (customer ‘services’) confirming I would receive no more but, guess what, another email the next day!Avoid this organisation unless you’re happy to be inundated with useless emails clogging up your inbox!",1
2023-01-26,I have been really pissed now. I have submitted my document on this website. My id has already been verified. It took me 5 working days to get my bank statement from my bank. They have not verified my document still it’s been 5 days now. All the chats say it’s under process. The workload is too much right. Dude it’s just one document. I already provided the my id. The second guy guys started this check drive.,1
2023-01-24,"So far I've found it to be quite a good site. Everything works fine and it's easy to use. The only problem is that if you'd want to withdraw you need to confirm your identity, okay… Fair enough, I did it and nothing… They've stated that it might take from 24h to 72h. After the 72h still nothing and it's still pending.",3
2023-01-24,"I signed up today, unknowingly I triggered a £50 bonus while on the site. No information was given on the bonus and so I used it as I have used bonuses on other sites. Unfortunately I found that rather than playing with the £50 bonus funds the site first used my real money funds, the opposite of many other sites. I therefore lost £50 of my own money without being informed that I was playing with real funds (which every other site does offer warnings for). I believe 888 is a criminal enterprise with the aim of fooling customers and deceiving them to make profit. Avoid at all costs.EDIT: Was asked to contact 888 following this review to which they gave me the same unhelpful copy and pasted response that I’d already received on their Livechat. Appaling service.",1
2022-12-20,Had a nice winner at 16/1 on the horses. Then had my account stake restricted to zero so I could no longer bet with them. They also refused to honour a £5 free bet which I was entitled to as a result of my win. When I queried this they said it was because I had withdraw some of my winnings. What else can I do with them if they won’t let me bet.  Not impressed.Edit: The pointless cut and paste response below is not helpful as I’m only leaving this review because their customer service team were no help.,1
2023-01-17,Wish I could say I had a great experience. I think there is cheating going on...because something just isn't right about the RNG but other then that. they weren't a bad site to play on.. graphics wise it has the potential to be the next pokerstars...,5
2023-01-02,Just a poor site been with them 3 weeks false advertising just take take ur money shud not be aloud to be a gambling site its a con site keep well away from this site con artists,1
2022-12-23,"Yet ANOTHER casino that takes issue with withdrawing. Everything works ok, until you make that cardinal sin & attempt to withdraw. Straight away, account restricted can’t login. Document request follows, you send off documents. Here nothing. Send another email hear nothing. It sickens me that so many casinos are getting away with this now a days. Take take take, but will do everything and anything to prevent paying out. For the the UKGC is not doing enough to protect UK players from these dodgy casinos. They sicken me to the core.",1
2022-12-15,I was enjoying my gambling and they asked was I OK with my gambling? I sent back reply but that wasn't good enough they suspended my account wanted to talk on phone. On my account I said contact only be Mail and they tried to ring so at this stage I told them again I was happy with my gambling again they said they need to talk to me in the end I said close my account because I wasn't going to take phone call.Then they said my account was suspended and don't use as if I was the one whom did wrong that they barred me. Also with their bonuses its very hard to withdraw money it takes for ever with waging. Sometimes you could be playing for a day before you have waged.,1
2022-12-14,"I have contacted them several times to file a dispute, and they have never responded!! The games have false pay out percentages as well as keep kicking you off to reset the game stopping you getting the bonuses. I have spent years playing online slots and know when they are cheating you. Avoid at all costs!!! I will be reporting them to the relevent standards agencies.",1
2022-12-22,bad customer service;if you email them you get automated reply that wrongly assigns your query and this continues before you eventually get a human response. Then when you reply to that you get automated reply that wrongly assigns your query again,1
2022-12-31,"They are really bad bookie. When you lost, it is ok. You win some money back, they lock your account without any reason. We should take them to the Court for unfairly doing.",1
2022-11-01,"The customer service experience has been horrible, the staff are poorly trained to answer your questions regarding your account, they are not aware of the promotions and the different tournaments available on the site. Keep getting the same promotion for 2 free roll even though there is only one event available, my tickets gone without an explanation, asked to speak to a manger told by the staff that a manger does not take calls on the spot. Waiting over 2 weeks for a manger call back and all I get from the staff when I call is stalling tactics and a couple blast tickets which is useless as the problem is still not resolved several days/weeks later. They need to train the customer service staff a lot better, as the ones I have dealt with there is only about 2 that knows what they are doing the rest us being paid to fill the space and give horrible customer service.Will be cutting my play time with 888 Poker and go somewhere else.",1
2022-12-01,"ROTTEN site. so many superusers and colaberating players, most of which are probably 888 staff.  this is the most compromised scamsoftware i have ever used.

And to 888 staff- Be sure that karma WILL find youthe one star is only becaouse i cant give zero or minus stars",1
2022-11-29,They can have a clear telephone number you can ring when you have a problem which is easy to use.They are a good site to use when you are losing money and they pay quickly as well but trying to talk to someone is a joke they put a stop on your a/c if you do not send them your bank details/statements they leave you in limbo.,1

2022-11-30,Help line was wonderful just now when I had made a mistake on a bet. I find their odds decent if not brilliant and their offers are very fair and easy to negotiate. I know they have other not so good reviews but I've been using them a couple of years and they have been fine for me.,5
2022-11-24,Just payed my 2nd visit to the site depositing £30 ended up winning £121 wanted to withdraw £100 but a message said I could only withdraw £98 as the remaining amount was a bonus! Bonus I lost because I withdrew some found that every odd !!!!!! Saying that the £98 was in my bank within minutes!,3
2022-10-26,"The most shocking company ever, i was warned by many not to trust this company, and now they have emailed me saying my verification documents were fine and my account will be open in 24 hours, this was 5 days ago, and now they are saying my documents are not ok to use, they have stolen my money, they have now been reported to the police, stay away from this company.",1

2022-10-16,"They are a company that has no value or credibility and I lived VERY BAD experience the last 6 days, all the amounts in my account were seized for fake reasons and Fake excuses do not existI don't know how they are given permission to practice this profession, it is horrible and frustrating to deal with themز I advise everyone to stay away from them because you will not see the money that was deposited or any profits you win",1
2022-10-20,"Dont waste your time, you open an account, make a deposit and then get an Email advising that your account has failed their security checks and is now permantly blocked, no explanation, and no refund. Strange that I have accounts with other online betting companies where i sailed through their security checks.",1
2022-10-15,"Used a game called Top Eleven. You are 888 Casino, 777 Casino, 888 Sports. 888 Poker. You advertised offers in the game separately, took the cash then say the offers are not valid as you are the same company. Presumably I should have known.  Lots of organisations have a number of separate companies within them with slightly different names. Common business practice but technically separate to reduce risk. Utterly and deliberately misleading. I have cause not to trust you so won't use any forms of you ever again. Can I say you morph more than Power Rangers?Sent from my Galaxy",1
2022-11-19,"Took my deposit and never credited my account! Ive had non stop problems with this site, deals that never exist, games constantly throwing me out, its the worst site ive played on, time for a move. Steer clear of this one.",1
2022-10-31,"Me and my partner signed up to 888 separately and received the 88 free spins, we both won money of the free spins and was able to wire transfer the winnings to our bank accounts which took 2 days overall. We didn't even put money on the website 😃 thankyou 888!",4

2022-10-13,"There is a lot of bots on it at the 2/5 5/10 10/20 Omaha cash games. For hours the tables has 1 player then as soon as I sit down, within 1 second there is a full table. They appear to all be from Sweden so I wouldn't be surprised if its all 1 person or 1 colluding team. Second I leave apart from 1 they all sit out. I tested this on around 5 different tables within 10 minutes.Tried 888 customer support but it wouldn't let me actually report it which is a fault on 888's side. very disapointed and down money from they games.In general I am up money so this isn't just a looser having a moan, please be careful.",1

2022-08-25,"Worst casino I’ve ever experienced, they do not like you winning, they take bonus offers and promotions from your account if you win with any bonus funds and bar you from any further promotions, terrible company run with terrible customer service, stay away from all 888 brands. Take note of all the negative reviews on here.",1
2022-09-08,"Rigged rigged rigged! Bad beats are the bread and butter of poker but 888 poker just keeps taking, taking, taking. It's pointless playing on this site anymore, I used to win a few tournaments and made 100's of final tables, but now I can't even make the last 30. A ""player"" will join your table, have an unbelievable run, clean out everyone's chips and ""magically"" get moved to another table after a few hands. Very convenient indeed. Don't waste your money on this BS site. Go to your local pub/casino and play live. Online poker is dead",1
2022-10-19,"User Wommatthew90Account was verified , Made first deposit of £60 Made first little football bet £30 which lost Then I received requests for cards bank statements etc etc , so I kindly asked live chat whilst the review of the documents is going on says can be 72 hours , can u process me back the £30 left, to card used 7 hours earlier to make the deposit , and she actually refunded to basically saying I won’t be getting anything back untill account is verified , Iv been in gambling industry 15 years and Iv never heard of holding funds only net profit funds untill accounts are verified , very disappointed with the first glimpseIf there customer service ..",1
2022-08-26,Absolutely dreadful company. Avoid at all costs.The poker favours the under dog and the casino is even worse.I have uninstalled the software and will not be back after losing nearly all the time. They also rip you off on the currency exchange if you are lucky enough to cash in.,1
2022-09-25,"It is a very good gaming site but what you need to know about the welcoming bonus?That the bonus and its winning is only accessible after the following conditions are met. You must wager in real money, (i.e. not bonus money or its winnings) 30 times the original bonus. So a twenty pound original bonus needs a total of £600 in bets. This must happen in 90 days. Additionally and this is important, not all wagers have a 100% contribution. A roulette wager is only worth 10 p in the pound so if your game is roulette, to access your bonus, you need to spend £60,000. phew….Away from the bonus complexity, the site is good.",1
2022-07-28,Terrible! The poker game on here is so rigged it’s ridiculous. I’ve never seen such scammed hands in poker in all my life. No matter what hand you have you will almost always lose to some worse hand that manages to hit cards on the turn and river. I get poker has an element of luck but 888 is ridiculous. If you have 4 aces you will likely still lose to someone with a terrible hand who shoves out of position and get a Royal or something crazy. Honestly people stay away from this site it’s worse than PokerStars,1
2022-06-17,Signed up to 888 with the minimum of fuss. Won a few quid with my £10.00 deposit only to find my account had been closed and would only be reopened if I supplied copies of Passport or Driving Licence. There's no way I'm supplying this sort of documentation to a Betting Site. This should have been requested as part of the signing up process. Feel like I've been scammed here.,1
2022-06-01,Tried to withdraw to be told I can’t withdraw to the card I used to deposit can only withdraw to an old Mastercard I told them a while back was no longer active tried ringing -spoke to someone who basically said card wasn’t allowed withdrawals (although it has in the past) I have  to email to her this reviewed how’s it fair to allow someone to deposit using a card they aren’t allowed to withdraw on?,1

2022-09-22,Advertised free spins no deposit simply not true as you must deposit and set up account games horrific and won't let you withdraw your money it's simply a con please do not get shafted by this con as its an absolute disgrace,1
2022-08-01,"888? More like ate ate ate. Cause that's all it does. Eats your money again and again and again. Now I never play for more than I can afford to lose, and I get its "" highly volatile"" but f off with that mouth ebola. I've played for 2 years now and not once have I come away with a win. Yet I've witnessed my own brother winning jackpots after jackpots. 3 times in one month and he doesn't even try. You guys really do have some sort of algorithm that learns a person's way of paying and playing, so you can strip em all of their money endlessly. Rigged like hell no matter what is played.",1
2022-03-17,"Dangle an enticing free bet offer to get you to sign up. You spend time signing up and deposit money to be given a message saying that “due to an internal decision, you are not eligible for  the free bet offer but you’re still welcome to bet with us!”. Not likely with shocking sharp practises like that. Money withdrawn, complaint put in with ASA and lesson learned - DON’T BOTHER WITH THESE COWBOYS.",1
2022-09-21,Terrible casino now £450 on in 7 days 0 return the slots just don't pay out and if you do trigger a bonus its Terrible.  This site has spoilt gambling for me I am closing my account now . It used to be a great casino too .,1
2022-03-27,"I’m not sure it’s as bad as people make out but one thing that is poor for a big brand is that they don’t half leave you hanging on withdrawals, if you win over a £1k. Most sites it’s just instant. I’ve had an average experience on here. However the withdrawals delay is massively irritating and may leave this site basically down to just that. If you win less than a k it’s in bank within an hour. Company makes millions just process the withdrawal.",3
2022-03-28,"I wouldn't recommend 888 at all. They make it as difficult as possible to withdraw your money and ask you for the same information over and over again hoping you will just get fed up. I currently have a complaint with the UK gambling commission in relation to one such case. There's much better platforms to use.Since their response below, they have refused to reply to my emails and have still not returned my balance to my account. Steer clear at all costs.",1

2022-05-26,"I only use the site for playing Black Jack. The site is OK, but the layout could be better.The reason I can only give 3 stars is because of the delay when making a withdrawal.

2021-12-19,Just like virtually every other uk registered casino it isn’t rigged or bent and has a good selection of the most recently released games.BUT - unlike many of their market rivals where they are almost instant withdrawals are painfully and disappointingly slow - rarely if ever is a withdrawal approved within 24 hours and sometimes it’s much longer.,3
2021-11-10,"As soon as I started winning alot of money on the live casino and withdrawing it, I then started receiving problems . They started with holding my money by closing my account down temporarily with no reason. Finally got it up and running again won a large bet it glitched and didn't go onto my balance .

2021-04-05,Terrible company and terrible site and far better companies out there with far more better opportunities   since the new site the betting options are terrible. their customer service is the worst I ever experienced and as for responsible gambling well they don’t care but use it an excuse to close your account when you hardly ever use them.

2021-09-09,"The win rate started off pretty good on this site but after they lure you in, they will rob you blind. They will say this is a random number generator but how do we know…. There is something very dodgy about this lot. They claim to care about responsible gambling but offer shiny promotions that will just leave you chasing something that will never come. I can’t wait for the “have you been ripped off by 888” adverts so I can show the deposit to win ratio. Best advice is go elsewhere.",1

2021-12-09,Absolute horrible service all round. Same as all the usual suspect sites regarding withdrawals. I am a genuine legitimate customer I won't be using this company again even if I ever receive a 60 withdrawal request. Me or any of my associates do not do business the corrupt greedy way. Money deposited within 10 seconds not prepared to wait five days for any amount of funds no matter how small or large 12 hours maximum should be sufficient in today's climate. Companies in the near future won't be around if these are the services that you are offering.,1
2021-08-03,To be honest it’s not a bad casino. You won’t get rich playing here but that’s gambling.

Now they will reply to this saying:""We would appreciate you contacting our customer service team to have this issue investigated further, by clicking the following link and providing your full details:888-external- en.custhelp.com/ app/ask/p/243""This just takes you back to their customer service which says ""the operations team have been unable to verify your account""And so it goes on forever!

I reached out to their support, they said restrictions were placed on the account, i asked what they were, she woudlnt tell me - i asked why, she wouldnt tell me. i got a standard copy paste response which did not answer my questions before the support just ended the chat mid conversation. Its nonesense, how can i use an accont, if they wont even tell me what i can or cannot do? fair enough if you cant reverse a decision, but at least tell me what restrictions have been put in place.",1

Opened an account, their sign up “suggested” a username, which I chose as it was pretty close to what I initially wanted, then the account was instantly suspended due to “irregularities” and a request for, I suppose, a “time out” which was odd, considering I’d only just opened the account, and have NO other gaming site connections. After numerous emails, which are obviously generated, no phone number which you can use to actually talk to a human, I am still suspended, now I’ve had to start approaching the ombudsman just to get my initial (and only) deposit back!

I still do not have my money. Not to mention that the whole verification process was ridiculous. Why can't the money just be put back into the PayPal account that was used to make the deposit?I just got this response that I should contact them for help. It is the same address that I have reached out to multiple times already. This response is just a PR move on their part. I still have not received my funds,1

I deposited £20 which 888 Sport ACCEPTED only to be told after I won almost £200 that my account was suspended and they will take 72 hours to get back to me. I am still waiting. My question here is this...1) Why accept my £20 deposit?2) Why let me bet using my £20 ?3) Why suspend my account ?I will be taking matters further as this is simply not acceptable and shouldn't be happening.",1
2021-05-10,Company took ages to repay my winnings into my account. So much so I complained and was given a free bet. But i messed up the free bet and immediately contacted them to ask them to update it (this was about 4 hours before the first bet was to take place). Got no reply.  Emailed again after the first bet saying I gave plenty of notice for my bet to be changed and then they emailed me to say they wouldn't refund me. Useless on all counts.After this I was put in contact with help team and they sorted out my issue promptly. After this engagement I have no hesitation in recommending this gaming company.,5

So then the £45 was randomly turned into £10 cash bonus, bonus for 888 because you can't collect it, so inevitably in seconds i lost that and then the £77 bonus i thought I had left had disappeared???

2022-07-30,This is my 2nd review of this bookmaker. I had an issue previously with verification. It took 2 months to verify my documents. Meanwhile my money were unaccessible. After 2 months I could finally login. First thing I did was to withdraw my money. The process took just two days. This is only positive thing with them. I left one pound there to see if I can bet. Surprise account restricted for betting. I couldn't place even one pound. The reason some mysterious traders decided due to type of my bets or amount of stakes to restrict my account. But support assure me that 888 has nothing to do with it. 😂 What a joke. I was just placing bets on btts market using £5 stakes. I wasn't even in profit. Piece of advice. Better go somewhere else. This cockroach company will treat you like garbage. I feel lucky that I was able to withdraw my money at least.,1

2021-06-28,I have been playing for couple months now. On the 20th of June I won £800. I notice on Wednesday it wasn’t in my account. I contacted 888 on the phone. They told me to send prove of the bank card I used to deposit the funds and id. I gladly sent it all to them. They told me they was happy and will pay shortly. Today is the 28 of June. I am still waiting on my winnings as they want the first card I registered with. I went in the bank and the bank stamped my statement and explained they can’t give me prove of a lost card. And I should show them that it’s the same account details on my card and statement. 888 want me to find the old card. I’m still waiting no reply. It’s very sad when you are loosing you have no problem. The minute you get a fraction of your money it’s all types of problems to get to you.,1
2021-08-26,"I’ve been on 888 a year now, only ever played the reels, specifically Gonzo megaways, always been an enjoyable game at the beginning win % was good not great never won more than £1200, obviously it takes a lot to get that win (£2bets each time). But recently it feels something has changed dramatically, algorithms, or some one has turned the win tap off, I’m  literally throwing money away with no features, no spins, no returns. straight wins range from 20p to £1:40!! It breaks me to see such poor return when £500-£700 has gone so quick. Feels like a sad rip off now, nothing to enjoy anymore, no possible big wins, with a global audience of gamblers and the best you are doing is 40p average wins, yes it definitely time to go elsewhere after a year! Don’t bother chasing it it’s not going to happen with 888 slots?",1
2021-05-28,The worst betting site ever. Maybe they should spend some money on a decent gambling experience rather than on marketing. Their customer retention must be one of the worst going.,1
2021-12-23,Took a £200 deposit then closed my account          Shocking fraudsters,1
2021-04-20,"Stay away from this thieving site.  I opened an account, depositing £155 over a few days on one of the many gaming sites they own ( Electric Spins). Not knowing 888.com held the rights to this site, and having self excluded from 888.com direct, my Electric Spins account was frozen. This site now by law must refund me my deposit. Easy I thought....what a joke.Having emailed back and fore for a month, my refund has been processed ( bank to my online account) Apparently there is something wrong with my card( The 1 they took my deposits from)  Must be your bank....  I have phoned them and they have not seen sight nor sound of my money from thieving 888.com.  so now have no choice but to report to Gambling Commission. No doubt I wont see my £155,  i was conned....PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS SITE. DONT BE ANOTHER SCAM VICTIM",1
2022-06-03,If I could have a minus stars I would. Waiting on my withdrawal and my account was closed before I could get it. Why is this? Absolutely out of order,1
2022-05-04,They will rip you off on withdrawal and blame bank..  my bank doesn't charge fee for deposit. But they say my bank charge me 75 for withdrawal stay away,1
2022-02-07,"Username aletto94, Congrats, keep hiring incompetent support agents.I have a pending withdraw for more than a week. I was asked to send the copy of the cards I used to deposit but I can not send it because those were virtual cards that were cancelled after the deposit, so I was asked to send a document from the bank that proof the ownership of those cards.I did it immediately and send it over.The problem is that the robots from the operation department do not read the emails I sent and do not see this document cause they keep asking me to send the copy of the cards. I tried so hard but I gave up and decided to close my account as only keep getting automated email from robots.Now tell me that you will look into it as I was told 6 times in chat and then a robot will send me the same email again. Well done you saved money on hiring competent people but you lose customers.",1
2021-09-25,"This is a money eating site. PLEASE stay well clear.  I have played sites for 4 years and this site is by far the worst.  Spent £3k and won three bonus rounds that paid a few hundred.  I have won £8k on other sites.  777.con and 888.con (yes con) are rubbish.  Both connected.  See there rating and read reviews and stay clear.  Close these people down. Start a vote. Close 777 or 888.com and save peoples lives, haven't we been through enough over the past year and deserve a bit of luck.  Like I said I play sites every week and by far these are the worst 2- 777.com and 888.com.  I appreciate that you lose sometimes, but give players some hope.  At least give a few more bonus rounds, it will give players a bit of hope when a few grand down.   Stay well clear , starting a campaign , I will give a £1 to everyone who does not use this con site and I will be better off.",1
2022-05-18,"This is a very poor betting site,they took my money on a error bet but would not give my money back ....very very poor site won't be on it again",1
2022-09-04,"888 are pretty bad and have various different bad behaviours which are quite obvious and not exactly in line with safe gambling...  The deal algorithms are definitely an issue here and play a big part in sending many to the deposit window.  You can almost guarantee you will be shafted with, or without a decent hand.I dont claim to be a poker guru but the deals here are relentlessly bad and the donkey always wins, i play on web based platform and kicks you off mid hand so you have to reload page and lose chips as a result (extremely often).  It really has become untenable to play here as a genuine poker enthusiast either running hot or cold you are doomed here!!I have learnt that the common factor in all sites millking and robbing our beloved community are the ones with very low attendance... this is probably a close tie with sky poker in all fairness,(which is pretty bad!)what a shame as 888 used to be a popular site many years ago, but  i suppose greedy lords and no investment or diversity means a sinking ship.... and that it has become!!",1
2022-09-14,"Absolute joke of a online casino they literally get u in by giving u a 1 or 2 average wins. So u think oh this ain't that bad and I'm up let's see if I can get a few wins tomorrow. U then come back next day play a few slots same stakes and get absolutely nothing apart from the odd 30p or 60p but your staking 60p a spin so yeah not even a win that's any profit. Its like they know u won yesterday and your up £200 and they just take it straight back by not allowing any win over your stake. Like a put £70 in the same slot doing 60p or 80p spins didn't get any bonus and like I said never really went over my stake amount on a spin. I don't know how this ain't getting more attention and looked into as its not just me, I've seen so many bad reviews and it's not just 888, Sky vegas/casino is exactly the same. Like I know these ain't pub slots but damn like this would never happen on physical slots. I won't be playing any of these online sites unless in the future there's a investigation that causes a good change that stops these sites conning and ripping their customers off.",1
2022-12-17,I hope can someone stop them !worst platform ever! Don't put money here,1

2022-06-06,Update 26th July. Still no resolution despite any number of promises that it will be dealt with in 72 hours. My £360 balance has now been unavailable to me for over 3 months without any explanation or assistance. Without doubt the worst customer experience I have ever encountered. Definitely not worth 1 star!! For 2 months now I have been trying to verify my account and immediately sent all documentation requested. When I complained they closed my account. The balance is £360 and I have been prevented from getting this for over a month. Still no response. If anyone at 888 bothers to read this my account is Tessy128 and I would appreciate some urgent feedback.Update on 21/06: 2 weeks later and no response and still no access to my money. Does anyone have any suggestions? Small Claims Court perhaps?Update 28/06: still nothing and I am unable to access my £360. Well over 2 months now. Absolute disgrace. Small Claims process started but this costs £50. I am beyond angry.,1
2022-01-04,I have been using 888 sport for a few years now    very good trustworthy bookmakers   fast payouts and never have to go chasing free bets owed A+++++,5
2021-06-04,Avoid this site for slots. You may win abit when you first join but after that its loss after loss. You put more in than you actually win back! Bloody scam!,1
2022-06-12,"So far so good, not feeling like ill get my next withdrawal, feel like something is going to go wrong, I hope they prove me wrong",1
2022-10-25,Gave it another shot. Not for me. That river low % many times in a row is too hard for the heart.,1
2022-01-22,the only reply you will ever get from this scam site is to re- apply to  their standard link .    I bet this helps you all ....not,1

2021-06-07,"Avoid this site. Just like 32red, low payouts and even slower withdrawals. Go with Skybet or Virgin, withdrawals are within 2 hours.",1
2022-10-26,Absolutely appalling customer services and procedures. I opened an account and initially passed verification and gave an email confirming this. I made a deposit but before I was able to do anything else my account was blocked. Apparently I had to provide further identification!!!! I cannot understand why as they had already verified me and received a copy of my driving license. I do not accept that I should produce further identification considering they have all information needed on my driving license. They requested to see my passport which I advised is out of date and they still wanted me to send it! I find this very bizarre as it’s out of date hence should not be legally used!!! I think they are very unprofessional and with that asked for my funds to be credited back to original payment method and close the account. They are ignoring my request and still asking for further identification. 888 when you read please don’t bother with your automated reply asking me to contact customer service!!! You are well aware of my complaint I suggest you refund and follow my request as my next point of call is resolver and gambling commissioner!UPDATE! I didn’t send any further identification and stood my ground and  just received an email saying my accounts now verified lol thanks i will now close the account! Cowboys!,1
2022-03-25,"Further update 1/4/22, 2 weeks without access or meaningful correspondence from them. What a farce of a company. AVOID.....UPDATE 30/3/22.....8 days after sending proof of ID still nothing. That's 12 days since my account was blocked after landing a small win. Another site took 10 minutes to get the account verified once documents were sent. Really poor turnaround which exceeds the times stated in their automated response. Whenever you contact them they fob you off saying they are busy and will get to it..... 8 days to allow access is crazy when I was fine playing until the moment I won!..........My first review seems to have been deleted but a week later and I still don't have access to my account after the decided to suspend my account following my first win!!! Never whilst I was better, funnily enough.... I've sent required ID and I've still not heard from them 4 days down the line. It feels very suspicious that you have to jump through hoops when you win and they don't respond in the timescales they advise they will. Never had this with other betting sites.",1
2021-05-25,"This Israeli owned company has a habit of breaking agreements and taking what does not belong to them, just like the land and houses in Palestine.888.com are fraudsters, they do not honour their Bonus promise. They look for any excuse not to pay. When you complain they send you round in circles with pre-planned responses. I am sure their response to this will be a conveyor belt response, check their responses to other reviews. Their poker site is very poor quality with almost a guarantee of regular bad beats. Do not waste your money at this site, there are much better ones out there. You will always get an automated response to your review. They then send you an automated response to go to their help site and look at frequently asked questions, absolute waste of time.As you can see below is their off the peg response which is identical to all their other responses. They tell you to contact them, when in fact it is just a link to start their nonsense complaints procedure all over again to waste more of your time.",1
2022-02-03,"Just played fishing frenzy.£200 gone in. The only actual way you can win is if the three or more boats come in.I’m going to say three as I personally have NOT ONCE had more than three on any of the online slots.Had the four fishermen bonus twice and won exactly zero.Bonus payouts ranged from 50 pence,I’ll type that again 50 pence ! to £7,£11,27 and one of around £75.considering at times the program will in minutes take £50,60,70 and in my last case £100 without giving ONE bonus how is it possible to win ? Simple answer it isn’t.I believe the programs are written so that you are encouraged to think that ‘the next bonus will be a good one’when in reality it simply won’t.So I’m clear this isn’t a case of sour grapes because I lost rather that it doesn’t seem possible to actually win as the bonus payouts are pitiful.I’ll be using this lesson from 888 casino to never waste,and it is wasting my hard earned money again and looking at these companies profits it is hard to think otherwise.The old adage still rings true today.’A fool and his/her money is soon parted’",1
2022-07-09,"I recently joined this dreadful crew without checking them out on Trustpilot. big mistake.they advertise extensively online making a big splash about their 20dollar no deposit bonus so I fell for it and deposited 20e for which I was surcharged even though the exchange rate is the other way.no mention or sight of the bonus for days. when I enquired about it I was treated as an ingrate and further I'd documents were demanded of me.I realised I had been conned and instructed them to close my account and erase my details.astonishingly, to me, they refused to so, even though not doing so is in breach of the data protection act here in Ireland and a serious criminal offence.I discovered that their boss is Lord Mendhellson of House of Lords infamy and emailed him with the provable facts of the matter. he has yet to reply.maybe disgruntled victims of this truly exerable crew should also contact the good Lord at his office.meanwhile avoid these criminals like the plague.incidentally, Trustpilot should use their algorithms to check the integrity of the excellent reviews of these parasites. my info. is that they came from an external PR company employed by 888",1
2022-02-18,"Absolute con. When I first signed up and was about to place a deposit down they provided an offer whereby if I deposited a certain amount it would essentially be doubled, however it was not made clear that this was on top of the amount already deposited so instead of depositing my initial £50 they took £100.Next you have 50x wagering requirement when first signing up which meant that from my initial £100 deposit that had accumulated in £200 overall due to their 200% welcome bonus, I needed to wager 50 times that amount to cash out.I played one game and won over £900 but because I'd acquired it using my bonus funds, it was capped at £500. Basically there was no way I was even allowed to reach the threshold to begin cashing out in the first place for they had effectively given the illusion of having more chances by depositing more, but made it all the harder.Honestly if I can at least convert one person to avoid this site, then I've at least succeeded. Do not under any circumstances deposit on this site/app. It's a massive con, and they are experts at wasting your time and money.",1
2022-01-15,"This is another company I stopped playing the live tables with. Again run by evolution gaming from Malta etc. Stay clear of. Absolute scammers. When u play with 888/ 777 etc theyl let u win alittle. Then get u chasing, down on money etc. They do this a number of ways, cutting u off/ logging u out, use electro magnetic ball which is remote controlled to bounce out of winning numbers. U never see their hands, theyl change the stats on the tables. Log in one one site and again on a different site that use them. Both will have different stats to the same table. They watch ur play and put stats when u log in to make ur play. So u end it playing against the table. Losing. How the UK gambling commission let them do this. The gambling commission are useless. They can even get ur money back. I'd advise if u play with them record when playing and review. Never play within the day. Ul lose 100%. Watch the roulette ball and at night b carefully. They expect people to b drinking whilst playing. So more tricks come out. Even buffing. Stopping u seeing the ball land. Absolute con artists.",1
2021-09-22,"Please do not use 888, I read the reviews and thought I would still try, huge mistake.  I know gambling is all risk and you never win long term but I enjoy a game, however on 888 I didn't even get a game.  I am £2k in on £2-£3 spins and the handful of bonuses were like 20x or 30x, the base game was terrible with only minimum wins.  The RTP is not as advertised and based on my experience must be 10%-20%.  It had taken around 500 spins to get my first bonus of 22x.  I bet on 32Red, Poker Stars and William Hill all of which I have spent and lost on, but never in my life have I seen such a low return.  Something is clearly going on with their odds, algorithms etc. When you play a game you will always return to that same game, so it's like having your own slot machine that no one else plays, so it is impossible to ever win more than you bet, check this for yourself, the reels will be exactly as you left your last game. Please Please Please, do not play on 888. I will now close my account and man up to the loss I made.  Ignore this review if you don't like money!!",1

2022-06-12,"I’ll be honest I really liked 888 casino but after how they treated my account I would not recommend them to anyone. I self excluded myself in 2019 or 2020, when it came to the end of the exclusion I emailed 888 and they said they would escalate the query then nothing a couple months later I emailed them again and once again they said they would escalate my request then the escalated team said that they would not allow me to return and worded it in a way to suggest it was permanent and could not be challenged (they then blocked both my emails!!), why make me email support for months with the suggestive bait of reopening my account just to shut the door on me? If you were going to ban me (for reasons I’m unsure) why make me wait months just to find out your not letting me back on your platform. You should rename your self exclusion as ban yourself if an account cannot be redeemed if after the term has been served the user cannot get back on. If you are currently an account holder make sure you don’t say you want to take a break otherwise they will overreact and not let you back on.Update: I contacted support (as their bot suggested) still the same response, useless company DON’T GAMBLE WITH THEM!",1

How many others money are you keeping ? 8v read the reviews and well I am not shocked one bit 1.7 stars 🌟 out of 5 is so poor.

2021-08-16,"Im afraid the reviews on here are true regardless of any replies you read, very hard to win anything with this company no matter what you spend, luck doesn't come into it with this company. I say this company (as opposed to this site) as 888 holdings open up so many small time casinos with great bonus offer to tempt you in,  you sign up with one you constantly get emails from other casinos with the same level of bonus offers, after depositing on many of these and barely winning anything, I came to come familiar with the low end games and the low end quality of the same layout, I then started to sift through the small print at the bottom to find out they all belong to 888 holdings, as i now am aware of this I avoid them like the plague, another red light for me is no quicker they have opened a new site another is closed down, they have so many going at anyone time. My advice would be to recognise the layout of the sites and sift through the small print for 888 Holdings, if the name differs do your research which wouldn't consume much time, to reveal any links. Personally Im unhappy to give 888 Holdings even 1 star but i have no choice. Take your hard earned money to a reputable casino where you have a fair chance of winning.",1

2021-11-12,"Absolutely disgusting, I began registering on some it the 888 sites following personal email invitations I received. It was going ok, wasn't really winning anything but was enjoying it nonetheless. Then earlier this week an email invitation came through from Solar Spins with a promotional code so I registered and used it. I only staked £20 but to my amazement I won £280, happy days which would make up for my losses on the other sites within the 888 group.However I logged on the next day to find my account had been blocked, I phoned customer services who said I should have received an email from the security team detailing what the issues were but the security team 'hadn't had time' to send it.So this person escalated it and still no news, I chased it again this morning to then receive an email saying my membership had been terminated along with all funds that were on all of the sites I had registered with, apparently I had been 'abusing' the bonus system.However the only bonuses I every used were from direct email invitations I received so how is that abusing the system ?! Funny that I wasn't banned when I was losing money yet one big win and my account is closed.Have raised it with the relevant authorities, how companies can get away with this is beyond me.AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1

2022-08-21,"My expierence with 888 are rather sad and very unhappy ending! I never wanted to come back and play poker there anymore! Now, i AM ABSOLUTELY POSTIVE CONVINCED that 888 poker is not run on RNG! Im pretty sure about 888poker is this,They dont run random algorithm, they run a very sophisticated triggered alogrithm. It detect card in play, calucate chips of whose in the hands, overall earning on the site, last winning,etc. To determine who win each hands. Those sites( 888, full tilt poker etc) favoured underdog( fish players who made bad call all time and play each hands all time) because 888 need them to come back and spend alll winning on 888 again, that why they are bias toward fish players lol. ITS QUITE CLEVER SYSTEM BY 888. I will give them full mark for that.Now im not beimg BIG HEAD but i do know im very good players and i do know when to fold weak hands unfortunely at 888, you will get punished for that cos 888 expect you to play every hands or otherwise you wil get punished.I Noticed that ggpoker, pokerstar and partypoker posted proof cert of RNG on their website EXCEPT, 888. They are corrupt! I knew they are dirtybag! STAY AWAY from them. I am very disappointed with them cos i expect a high standard of poker in 888 but it was not to be! Far too many inconstience of same hand and too easily Predictable on flop too. This is not HOW RNG is run! SOME1 SHOULD INVESTAGED THIS COMPANY! Of course its very possible they already bought some1 off! Im seriously thinking of writing  email to gaming commisoon about 888.I KNOW how rng work. This is not it! I wasted 200euro on 888 lol.",1

2021-06-04,"As with many of the reviews on here, mine is about an enormous lag between hitting withdraw and actually seeing the money. I've waited almost two weeks, been told on four occasions that my winnings would be with me ""that day"", only for them not to arrive and when I've pressed on what the problem is I have been told it's been ""forwarded to the appropriate team"" who have, of course, 72 hours to look into it.The customer service is polite but not rooted in any knowledge as to the situation you're trying to address and they clearly don't have any sway in making anything happen.I did email their operations team who haven't responded either.If you're looking to open a new account, I'd strongly advise avoiding 888 - the systems are clunky and it has quite obviously customer service flaws, which are very frustrating.Try Paddy Power, Bet365 or Sky Bet for an all round better experience and much faster withdrawal time.This lot are useless.UPDATE - I did what they asked below and... got thrown into another round of automated responses and ""72 hours"" for a response nonsense. As I said, they don't care - still waiting and if I could give less than one star I would.UPDATE - I was contacted by the customer support team who basically said they value me as a customer but have no controlled over when payments get processed and that 72 hours is a guide time... interestingly they were very confident in telling me a time when it meant I'd go away, but as soon as a trustpilot review was posted, they've become very attentive and also non committal.

2022-04-10,"This is a pretty rogue operator but they have become worse over last 12mths, I have used their poker site for 10 years and i have always known the beast as it were... However just recently it has become aggressively poor with its conduct, payment touchpoint behaviour and customer service.  I recently made a deposit via apple as i have always done as a regular method of payment, and it was declined due to a geoprahical location issue??, fair enough I am in the uk, on a uk data network and paying with a uk bank card thats been used many times before without problems.  I put this down to a glitch and tried to make the deposit again... this time it went to a pending status and i had confirmed this on my banking app with biometric approval.  888 left this for three hours before debiting the recent request and the previously declined request.  Granted this could be a technical issue with APi's etc so i didnt challenge it.  A few days later i tried to deposit again and i was met with the same issue of reuesting the deposit and the app crashing and declining the deposit but the bank approving the payment via biometric authentication, the cashier showed a failed payment so i tried again and i was told the payment had failed again after having to approve the payment request.  At this point i tried to contact them for advice before attempting to deposit my account... They responded by telling me to try the deposit request again but via html as opposed to the app, so I did and the same response as before saying that it had failed, so they said they couldn't help and to try again via html.In the end i gave up and 6 hours later every failed request had been taken from my bank, their software and behaviour is terrible, luckily on the second time of the payment behaviour i recorder the process i was taken through and the immoral and illegal advice advice i was given during these touchpoints, I have passed a very lengthy report to legislators with lots of video and messages so I am hoping someone brings this shower of sh**te back in line with gambling regulations..... My advice is dont wait to be the victim just avoid this site and look for other platforms and check their reputation online before depositing currency at 888!",1

2021-04-01,What can I say? I read some reviews about 888 and became worried about a withdrawal I made yesterday. I needn't have. It arrived in my bank account the very next day. Their customer service team have been nothing but extremely helpful and polite. Have had a really good experience with this company.,5
2021-03-30,"Wow.The absolute rudest customer service representative I have ever encountered! Hi Gabriela!!I had a query about 888 deciding to split my winnings over 2 cards, despite one being cancelled.They owe me £92, for which they say I have to provide ""proof"" that it was cancelled. Gabriela proceeded to lecture me on the fact that we live in the 21st century, and I should know how banking works..for the entire conversation, she was rude, would not let me speak, and patronising beyond belief!! I have to jump through hoops to get MY winnings , instead of 888 just doing a payment in error form with their bank, and paying to the correct card.I'd close my account now, but I want my £92!!!They are clearly not bothered...look at the generic reply to every single bad review.Nothing gets followed up at allHorrendous experience.Avoid!!Awaits generic reply",1
2021-03-24,"i really like 888 played for many years, and payout i get in 24 hours after it get paid out... i see many complaines, but never had a big prob.. with 888 and couztumor support is good!but that waz long time ago wery long :/ lol",5
2021-03-23,So my reply to my review was they will offer help they only help they have offered is to close my account an return my money  over a week later from opening my account disgusting behaviour from this company to basically offer promotions that I can bet at Cheltenham ⚠️where this is untrue as it will take weeks before verification this is fact⚠️ in my experience  any other betting site can verify you withing days alsoWarning this 888 want to many personal documents regarding finacial incomes asking for statements of bank accounts etc... you do no need to send you bank details as this is done at your own expense do not use this company ⚠️⚠️⚠️,1
2021-03-23,Won a good amount got paid within 2 days also had a problem with free bets when I signed up I contacted them and they gave me my free bets straight away will be using again,4
2021-03-15,"Ok got paid again, only problem I had is it’s taken since Friday, and seeing the reviews doesn’t help. I guess I have been lucky so far and been paid out twice.. but it isn’t the experience I want... sitting wondering if I will get paid out. Worried if u are going to stop me getting paid.. as I’m seeing u do it to a lot of people .. Well good luck with the future I’m leaving this casino before I become unlucky and not get paid any winnings..",5
2021-03-15,So I thought by all the bad reviews I would never put my cash into here but I had  received 40 dollars in free tournament tickets and I would spin any winnings of the poker tickets in casino I got my final lot the other day and won $6 on my last $ won 25 i no its not a lot but I know that was the minimum I could withdraw by bank transfer so I withdrew it I uploaded my bank card and a letter before they asked me to verify id and received payment today so I can't fault them at the minute in my experience  great company,5
2021-03-14,Follow up on the response turns out I hit big on a sports bet and they didn't want to pay it so they altered my profile and settings and barred me for all 888 sister sites and at the end they admitted they was an unjustifiable loss it was just beyond their control meaning they dont want to pay me at all. Anyone know any sites that are legit?,1
2021-03-12,"Don’t usually leave reviews but I felt like I had to here. Been with 888 for a few weeks now, do a lot of horse bets and like the slots too. Not had any problems except a couple of times tried to place a treble bet and it couldn’t place it but I wasn’t sure why. But the majority of the time all works great. I made my first withdrawal two days ago and then read the reviews on here and was panicking I’d be waiting weeks for it and things would go wrong like some of these reviews say. But it was fantastic, I had the money in my bank account within about 18 hours of withdrawing from site which I think is great! I then made two more withdrawals and yesterday and have received both this afternoon again. I’m enjoying my time with 888 and hope others may give it a chance too! Thanks! Treaclepop21 :)",5
2021-03-11,"First issue I have had really, and it’s a big one... I am not one for complaining about bad runs or the table being a fix, gambling is an enjoyment and a hobby... if you can’t afford to lose don’t do it.I have withdrawn £9000 a few days ago, and it had been transferred (apparently).  I am being told to wait 5 days for visa to make the payment, only my bank and Visa have no record of the payment being processed.I have sent concerned emails requesting someone check and feel rather fobbed off.  If I had deposited 9000 it would be straight in your coffers and that would be that.  Every previous time, a withdrawal has been transferred it has hit my account the same hour, and there has been a few.  My concern is the lack of empathy or proof I have been provided to suggest it has been made, and why 888 are not concerned about £9k missing.I believe that they haven’t transferred the money, and would like to keep it in their account for as long as possible before paying.This has really made me consider if I will be using them again, they have revoked my bonuses.  I haven’t had any for a while now and now this.Customer service at its finest.Paddy Power maybe a better option.",2
2021-03-09,"This site is actually a joke, they’ve held my money for 3 weeks now because I need to verify my ID I’ve sent it across 3 times and all I get is they are not wholly visible or poor quality yet you can see everything crystal clear, seriously never use this site. Money grabbing donkeys.",1
2021-03-08,"BAD!! BAD!! BAD!! opened an account with 888 verified myself deposited and played, got myself a little win and requested my withdrawal but now because I tried to withdraw they have closed my account telling me I have another account on there network that is closed and won't let me withdraw, if that's the case why did they verify me AND let me deposit, DO NOT deposit on here absolute joke of a company.",1
2021-03-06,A new review site is great 👍 a little longer than others to withdraw but otherwise brilliant well done 888,5
2021-03-02,"Have not had a problem with 888 casino, however had an account with sister site Bucky bingo....waiting on withdrawal from them to get an email from 888 customer security team telling me that my account is blocked! How can you justify blocking one whilst constantly using another. Waiting on £2000 told withdrawal would be processed as the withdrawal was made prior to the account getting blocked. Again nothing, sent several emails call up to be told yes it’s fine, but you need to speak to the customer security team well 888 how do I do that because this is all quite frankly absolutely ridiculous!!! I’m verified, you were happy to accept deposits I was able to with draw 24 hours later my account is blocked and cannot get any update!?!!!",1
2021-03-01,"I went on to Virtual sports (I know you have virtually no chance of winning on this) but on this occasion I backed four teams over 2.5 goals in virual football in ""Gold Race"" section....believe it or now they all won and I stood to win 165 euro....my unsettled bet stayed in view for about 15 minutes and then just disappeared....no longer in bet history....just gone....disgusted with this...I cant find a link to cancel my account with these guys so next best option was to set my deposit limit and the lowest I could set it to was 20 euro per day....but I would love to just cancel my account....",1
2021-02-27,"I have the same problem as most, you win and make a withdrawal and sure enough there’s a problem with the info I given them, even though there isn’t",1
2021-02-25,Where my money my withdrawal still hasn’t processed and it’s been nearly 2 weeks I’ve emailed you and you have said it should be processed the following day and you have been saying the same thing for the last week your quick enough to take my money but not pay out,1
2021-02-25,Found the 888 casino after searching for top-ranked online casino on slots.academywas good play no issues withdrawing winnings,5
2021-02-23,Good casino. I've never had problems. Fast withdrawal,5

2021-01-29,If you like your bets to have cash out then no point using this company. It's a hit or a miss whether some of your games have cash out. Website pretty slow and you have to constantly log back in even if you flick off for a few seconds.,1

2021-01-29,"I have recently signed up to 888. Decided to have a few bets on the football again and the Bet £10 Get £30 was a decent offer.Followed all the instructions and still have not received my £30 free bets. I have contacted the support email and all I receive an automated message telling me what to do, which is exactly what I had already done.This feels basically like theft. Used other betting sites in the past and never had an issue",1
2021-01-24,I have recently  joined 888 .I deposited £50 receiving the £50 welcome bonus ..  with the £50 I deposited  i luckily won £150Tried to withdraw £100 but was told I would lose my £50 bonusI think this is a disgrace... I should receive my bonus after spending my original  £50 ... another issue is that I can not for the life of me work out how to cash out as well,1
2021-01-22,I have spent thousands of dollars and been a loyal customer to 888 for many years. I was shocked to find out that they randomly closed my account out of nowhere!!! I have messaged 888 multiple times after waiting weeks they responded telling me to message responsible gaming.... I messaged them and they took forever to respond and when questioned all they say is my account was temporarily closed for responsible gaming reasons... no answer as to why I asked why because I have done absolutely nothing wrong and all they said was it is associated with other accounts that have been closed for responsible gaming reasons ... This is not a reason and has nothing to do with me... I'm so confused and can't believe they would treat me like this after being a loyal customer for so many years... I'm pissed!,2

The disabled my account 5 days ago and have stopped talking to me over the emails. I will get the gambling commission involved now because this is a complete joke.I am a gambler like a lot of us but I have never missed a payment of any bill in my adult life. I have very few debts but 888 seem to know more than me.They have £50 of my money in my account but won't even give that back. I have been a 888 customer for at least 10 years. I want my money back and I will close my account. Going through the trust pilot and gambling commission route as they won't get back to my emails.Stay away from this cheating gambling site, they don't even look after their old customers.Update. Got my account open but took my money out and have not used this account again. Took me ages to sort this out and it got very boring. I will use Betfair now.

2020-10-24,"Eventho I quit this casino with a positive balance, I have a very negative taste in my mouth after having been customer of this absolutely disastrous company.The website and user interface is overwhelmingly slow and garbage, hard to navigate and find what I want.They insist time limits on you regardless of your settings or if you didn't want any limitations at all in the first place. Like in the middle of a match I'm being kicked off and can't log back until next day? Not very productive when you want to see out an acca to cash out the appropriate moment.Also the site often 'crashes' or 'freezes' on me and won't let me back in from the same browser, but another one will do just fine.. however tho, while this happens my session time still ticks. They really don't want me to play there? Especially when I'm on a winning streak this happens too often.The offered odds are often misleading, they also like to hide important information from players, like hiding first names of fighters in MMA matches so you have to look the fights up on another website to know what to bet on.. then i made screenshot and opened ticket to support about it, only to get back to me days later and outright LIE into my face saying that the names are there and don't see what my screenshot is showing... I mean this support guy should be fired straight away, it's a pathetic blatant attempt to cheat me and even make me stupid when caught.Speaking of odds, the vig is stupid high no surprise.Cashout is often grayed out as soon as it's winning and immediately available again when i'm losing.I'm done with these scammers and move my account to an actual betting house, one that lets me play as long as I want and one that won't crash on me strategically.. and one where I can choose language.",1
2020-10-16,"Hi so just to let everyone know how there investigation into my issue ended, it was as expected from a shambolic company, as yous will have seen they had ask me to contact them so they could investigate my issues, so sent me an email telling me they had refunded me  a £1???? , they got slightly confused this was about yet another game that froze, and not the game where i had £136 winnings and also a video to prove as i screen recorded it freezing, so sent about my 100th email to tell them the issue yet again , and asked to have an instant reply to confirm they had it and that it was being looked into, guess what no reply , so decided to give them one last call, and of course got there usual not friendly, unhelpful advisor who claimed they had no email, so i ask him to hold the line and i would resend while we were on the phone, then strangely he found my other emails and gave me the same answer that lead me to write the reviews decision has been made £2 stake returned ,case closed nothing they can do about it, so basically you cant have your winnings you fair and honestly won before there game froze as they always do on that site, so people please anyone thinking of joining this site DONT AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS, there is so many better sites ,paddy power, betvictor, etc etc where if you win you get your winnings and not cheated out of it them or ignored till you write a review ,and if youve an issue there helpful staff sort it, i played on nearly all the betting sites and this is by far the worst site anyone could ever join ,your experience will end badly TRUST ME all the negative reviews are for a reason. So this final review will probably get a response from 888 again saying ""there sorry iv had a bad experience click the link and we will fully investigate"", which is really them just trying to fool people who are reading my review into thinking thats what they do, and that there helpful, i will not be replying or calling they know the issue they have my email address, they have my number let see if one of there management team can actually manage to deal with a problem, wont hold my breath",1
2020-10-14,I am matched betting so have signed up to many bookies and 888 is by far the worst. It is extremely slow to log in to and then slow to navigate. They're not clear about the sign up offer before you sign up so you feel cheated before you even start. Whilst matched betting I had laid a bet on the exchange and went to back the bet on 888 but got logged out before I placed it which could have left me £80 down on the exchange. Managed to get logged in again 2 mins before the race and placed a back bet but at much worse odds. Also the odds have a habit of changing from clicking on accept bet to the bet being registered. I made money from their sign up offer but other than that they were a negative experience from start to finish and I will be very reluctant to use them again.,1
2020-10-13,Some half decent promotions but odds and available markets not the best. layout and app not user friendly and quite difficult to navigate.Markets on races tend to close bang on off time even though the race is not off and even delayed. Quite a few snags which can become frustrating.More sports and football offers to compete with the big betting sites.,3
2020-10-02,Can't put a no stars unfortunately...Trading standards please look into this company unbelievable how they can still be running when the odds are clearly into just raking in the money don't even go there to say this is random slots wins...

Lost the game and we logged out. When we tried logging in again password was wrong so we left it. Unauthorised payment was taken out three day’s straight. I lost about £1,175.00. Emailed to 888 about it and the response I got was basically it was my fault for giving my password - which I didn’t since my password was only typed in by me not my dad. Timings of the money taken out did not make sense as it was early mornings all the way to evening and my dad was at work which is weird to think that this would be their response. They said there accounts are secure and there is no way there could be third party party involved which is a joke because whoever was hacking tried to get my CVV number and got it wrong.Advice to anyone: this site is not worth a penny of your time to join.",1

2019-10-02,Very poor. As previous reviews state all the problems with the site I was sweating a bit after reading them waiting on my withdrawal...... which took them FIVE days to process. 7 days to get the money. The site is terrible to get around and every time you go to the cashier it doesn’t bring you back to the game you have to start from scratch and negotiate your way through again. I won’t be using it again. Online chat is supposed to be open between 13:00 hours and around 8 or 9 at night but twice I tried to used it between these times and it said “Chat currently unavailable”. Site is strategically layed out to make it difficult to find where to withdraw. Also they have had their own staff write false reviews as a previous reviewer stated. Cowboys.,1
2019-09-27,"Instead of an indepth review here is my last email to their CS - one of the many emails:Having said that I am not happy with the way you are handling things. First of all if you requested verification you should have restricted my account pending that and stop taking bets. Instead you froze a payment from over a week ago while processing other payments without informing properly and let me use the account as normal. I informed your CS agent Alexandu almost a week ago about the issue requesting to convey my message to the Operations team and he completely ignored my request. You're taking 3 days to respond to emails , I sent you this email on the 23rd and you are responding on the 27th. I would imagine your Operations department is dealing with similar delays? also I'm not happy that it took you so long to decide it's id's that you want and not an explanation for the so-called discrepancy in spite of informing of the former. Another issue is with a way you allocate withdrawals. Still waiting for your department to pick up and process the last withdrawal request and now we are in the second working day. And once they do they seem to be randomly sending large amount to Skrill without following the correct procedures. I used a card deposit twice only to see the original deposit plus winnings to be sent back to Skrill which I hadn't used in a while. Also withholding my cash with the excuse of the so-called ""discrepancy"" is highly irregular. I would assume you have a UK license so for a UK licensed site I would expect more professionalism. Last but not least your site is riddled with technical issues, disconnections, pages that don't load etc. I don't feel safe in using their site anymore.",1

2019-02-01,888 dirty rotten scoundrels I won £30.00 on Thursday on the blackjack then last night won £230.00 so now they want ID before I can withdraw.So I emailed them what I'd I had at this time the withdrawal was in pending status. So I logs on to check if its still in pending status only for the funds made available in my betting account.The dirty tricks they play. So I phoned them up garble garbel so I told them to close my account and when the operations team have reviewed my documentation if it isn't sufficient ask them to email me or phone me.We all know why they returned the funds to the betting account. Hoping that I'd had a bet again. I don't play dirty tricks.We have all seen the movie Casino. When the casino deliberately delay the flight of a punter that had a win the previous nite.That's one game 888 won't win.They are beyond acceptable I even asked phone support to close my account but still I was allowed to log in. In the end I closed my account myself. From my expiernce of gambling if an incident like this happens its for one reason only. They want you to bet again. The more you bet in time the more likely you are to lose. Considering reporting this incident to the gambling commission.,1

2017-12-04,"They have a horrible support team and I question the legitimacy of their extremely aggressive ""safety measures"". Over my 5 years playing on the site and paying well over 5k in rake I have had to verify my ID on 2 separate occasions. And today they locked my account to ""verify the source of funds"" while I was mid game in 2 MTTs after depositing only 1k two days prior.I replied within 4 minutes and sent them what they asked for but did not get a response and had to watch as my ~100 dollars in  equity got blinded away. If you are going to block/lock an account it should not be this difficult to get it unlocked, especially if the account was currently committed to multiple tournaments when the account was closed.I find this type of practice disturbing and if I had strictly online poker player it would be near impossible to meet the standards they ask for and they could easily rob someone of their balance or wait until they try and cash out after a win like many other users here have pointed out.",1

It was pretty annoying because there wasn't any message from 888 (e.g. ""Servers down, please be patient while we fix the problems""), just blank. So we were left wondering what would happen for over 20 minutes. Also, I am unable to withdrawal on the same card that I use to deposit. I asked 888 customer service, but they said the problem is my bank, that they wouldn't allow deposits from gaming sites. I contacted my bank, and they said there is no such regulation, and that it's the site that has chosen not to allow withdrawals. Now, the only option is a wire transfer, which is inconvenient and more costly. All in all, I like the site and service, but am very disappointed that I can't withdrawal with the same card I used to deposit with.",4
2017-02-04,"The program although it looks good, it does not run 'smooth' quite like stars does and there is alot less customisation with the table setup (no colour spectrum to choose felts and backgrounds from).There is a much smaller selection of MTT's to choose from with strange price jumps. from 5 dollar the next up is 12, then from 12 its 30? why not 15's 20's 25's etc. Doesnt make it easy to manage your bankroll wisely.The smaller player field however does make it slightly easier to cash in the MTT's but obviously this is counteracted by the fact there is less prize money for winning/final tabling.next is the exchange rate (or charge possibly?) for depositing/withdrawing at 888.example if i open both pokerstars and 888 right now...a deposit on stars of £1000 gets $1217.61a deposit on 888 of £1000 gets $1189obviously its a small difference you may argue, but honestly why should there be one. both sites are exchanging the same currency.and lastly and by far the most important factor for a regular grinder, the VIP system is very poor.on stars you earn starscoins for every single fee you pay for a tournament etc, these coins mount up nicely in their program and can easily be exchanged for cash added to bankroll. with using $1000 bankroll for example to register for tournaments you would easily have $30 ish dollars worth of coins to cash in.888 does NOT work like this. You have 'level ups' when you level up you earn a very meagre amound of 888s coins equivalent. But heres the catch, you can only level up a certain way. so you dont just play games and continue levelling. you for example will have to 'play 3 days in a row' to level up. So if you spend 10000$ on registering or 10$ over 3 days, you earn no different",2

2016-08-24,"do not play on this site because if you win they make an excuse not to pay you or even better close your account so you carnt log back in.they keep adding new casinos aswell so they can suck you in,if you look at the promotions page if you get an email offering you this bonus and that bonus,go to the bottom of the page and if it says cassava group im telling you they will scam you for every penny youve got,wont pay you if you win.this company should be blacklisted and closed down.dont forget company name cassava or 888 holdings.its them with nice cars and houses not you because theyve scammed you.",1

2016-07-18,"I've been playing poker on 888 for a couple of years now and what I can say is that the payments have always been done accordingly when I had to cash-out, customer service was always top-notch, and overall I had and still have great experiences at the tables.Overall, they have both  my respect and loyalty for being consistent with their services throughout the years.Good job 888 !",5

2016-04-08,"Hi, first i would like to say that I love the site but the one thing that I don't like at 888 is the short break time. The break starts exactly at 55 min and I think it would be best to wait all hands in play end befora the start of the break, because sometimes you play a long hand and don't get to use the break to go to the bathroom or even prep a fast dinner or something. So if I could change one thing at 888, it would be the break time!  Hi, I'm editing my review because i forgot to talk about something else on it. It's about the 888 Poker Club where at a certain level you can't get to next level only by playing poker (wich is my primary activity on the site). Although I enjoy the sportsbook and the casino, I don't use them frequently in order to get passed to next level what stucks me in my current level and keeps me from gettiing gold tokens and the consequent rakeback. This way, although I'm putting a nice poker volume almost every single day I ain't getting rakeback because I simply don't get to the next level by only playing poker anymore. It's important to mention that the rakeback is an important part of the revenue to a poker player, so I would like to suggest to you guys to allow unlimited poker winning points which would bring to a fair rakeback level at the site.",4
2016-04-08,"Actually Amaya/pokerstars doesnt respect his customers. Im playing for a living and put now alot volune on smaller sites like 888 and must say it is a nice experience. Software is good, like the structure of the tournaments, support is nice. I feel like respected again. Ty 888.",5
2016-04-06,"Surely it can't be that difficult to check the database (win or lose) before paying withdraw or deposit to see if the person is self excluded?!!! 888 earns enough money not taking off problem gamblers.  I've been battling with my gaming addition for years, and this is only a relapse... The fight goes on! :) *They have just e-mailed me to inform me that they will be refunding the £590 out of good will :) I'm so happy now",4

2016-01-09,"At first I would like to thank 888 and its team for being what they are - an awesome alternative to the Big Pokerstars. It´s fun to play on your software and the tournaments are simply perfect!This is a site where good poker gets rewarded... One thing i would wish for the future is the ability in your software to block all casino games. They are part of 888 and this is good as it is, but I as a pure poker player don´t need them, but it´s very hard don´t to play a short roulette session if a tourney gets boring ;) Stay as you are and perhaps you´ll give us the cance to block casino games ;)",5
2016-01-09,"I made the move from Pokerstars because I always seem to run bad!! So I decided to try some smaller sites like partypoker, i poker network and 888 poker for their apparently softer Mtt fields... and 888 poker didnt dissapoint! !! 888 is by far the best alternative to the biggest site Pokerstars who has recently changed ownership and are doing everything to stuff over the players!! I played 20 mtts average b uy in 50 usd in 3 days on 888 and i made it in the money 2 times... and also 2 final tables which one i took out first and second one i took out 3rd! My goal is to make 10 k this month so I can spend time with my wife and daughter in her country and see my sick father in law and bring my family back home... and on 888 poker I believe I can achieve this!!! Im nearly halfway there! Also the software is great!! Smooth and plenty of room on the tables to fit a Hud... Thank you 888 for making my experiemce so enjoyable!! The only negative I will point out so my review doesnt seem too good to be true is once when I made it to heads up on final table one guy I knocked out earlier was abusing me in the chat box and trying to distract me so I loose and I wish their was an option in the chat box to call a moderator as I didnt want to turn my chat off as I was talking to the other player and players who were true gentleman... I guess this sought of thing happens on every site though... its actually probably worst on pokerstars... again from my heart.. thank you 888!!!",5

There's a great variety of games (NLHE/PLO/LHE) plenty of tournaments and the casino adds a nice touch when you need to get away from the tables for a bit. Cashed out a few times and they are always quick.

2014-12-03,Good selection of games and the poker is quite cool. One thing i can say which i think is really scummy.. is that when you withdraw the option to reverse the withdrawal is there for about 48hours while they process the payment.  There's no reason for this other than the fact that they're banking on the fact that the gambler in you will make you reverse it and play on. Very smart yet very scummy,3
2014-11-24,"this room is realy nice , but today i was getting disconnects from room many times;/ fix it please",5
2014-11-16,"The poker is ok - watch out for the lobby being out of sync and sometimes dead slow in comparison with your table.  Not helpful and it happens too often. The mix of games are ok but don't expect the size or frequency of e.g. Pokerstars.  888 is gradually changing for the better, but perhaps the growth is producing issues.  Disconnections happen too often, especially recently and can be very frustrating.   I would hesitate to try the casino slots if bored.  I have played The Great War over the past few weeks and have had to send screenshots in on around 19 occasions so far due to incorrect payout.  In spite of an obvious error, customer services ALWAYS send out and email telling me that the payment says no win (I can read) and suggest I look at the paytable!  This implies I am a complete idiot and it would be nice if they used common sense to look at the screenshot and see they the payout is nothing like it should be.  Several weeks after the first incident I am still finding the same error in the game and still having to complain 2 or 3 times before I get anywhere. The last customer service(!) rep asked me for date /time / system etc in spite of the screenshot showing time stamp and game ID etc!  I will ring and try to get through to a supervisor and hope they are interested in fixing the game as well.  It really should be able to trust the games up there but I don't now - especially as they won't even admit the mistake, say sorry and pay out my correct winnings!  Grrr. Do use other sites but you have to find your own level of play in the site you use.  I have used 888 for around 7 years now so understand it up to a point, but do use others at points of frustration..........",3

2014-04-02,"I've been playing Multi table tournaments on 888 the past month, and have a few suggestions to improve the product: 1) Deal making on the final table. This is a MUST.  It's very frustrating when down to the last three and we want to deal but cannot. Time to implement this. 2) If playing multiple tables ( say 6), when you're about to act another table will pop up when it is your time to act as well. This is extremely frustrating and you lose track of tables very easily.. This needs to be fixed. Have a table pop up ONLY when you're done with the table you have selected. Other then those suggestions I enjoy playing at 888. A decent selection of tournaments an the software is above average. 1000% better then Party Poker..",4

The hot promotions and daily deals are also a great thing for members to take advantage of.  I mostly play the slots and arcade games on 888.com. The graphics are very clean and vibrant; it's one of the things that always keeps me coming back to the site.  Another great thing about the site, is they add new games frequently, so you get more to choose from all the time, which I think is really important for an online gambling site.",5

2014-01-13,"This website is easy to use and has great variety of players. It is a wonderful experience using this website. There are always a range of players and I really liked the high amount of money you get at the start. The reason I didn't give this 5/5 is the VIP program. At the start it is really good, but once you've past the £8, it is quite hard to earn points. Overall, I will recommend this to most people with time but the reward system needs improvement.",4
2014-01-13,"The website has a very user friendly feel, making me feel like I want to keep playing, and the winnings are great.

You can start to use the site without downloading the software and there is usually a bonus offered when you sign up. I started using the 'Instant Play' option, which means you don't have to download anything. However you also have the option for the free download or to use the mobile app. It's fun, I usually play the Blackjack tables but you can also play roulette and slots.

2014-01-02,"I have used many casino/gambling websites and 888 is the best one that I have discovered to date. The number of different games available are extensive, my personal favorite being premium roulette. There are so many different functions include 'quick spin' so that you don't have to wait a long time for the ball to land (and get your winnings). You can also use 'auto play' which allows you to use a well thought out strategy and earn you more cash. There are many different deposit methods and the withdrawal is so quick and easy.

This is the best poker website I have used in a while! The cashouts are fast when you ask for payment and the customer service on the site really do answer with clarity and well mannered. I only used the site for 2 weeks but I managed to move the profits in my account from $565 to $1,393 and this is proving to be a superb way of affording a few extra things I need. If you love poker and looking for the market leader in this space of online poker then look no further.",5
2013-12-13,"I signed up for 888 Poker only 2 weeks ago, When u sign up... they give you 8 free tournament tickets just for joining, I was fortunate enough to play well in some of those freeroll tournies. After only 4 days of playing, I earned a Free $530 entry to the $500,000 Super XL Main Event!  Althought I had a very bad beat on my last hand of the tournmanet, I still walked away with $1,014,05 in earnings for coming 85th!!   What a great experience! Join if you love poker!!",5
2013-12-05,"Just won over $9,000 in the super XL tournament after making my first deposit of only $20 dollars a few days prior and been given a complimentary free ticket to the event for making my deposit. Although I had played on the site in the lower stakes games for around 3 months making the most of my fantastic welcome package offered by 888 and stretching out my bankroll & game play to better hone my skills playing in a lot of the freeroll events offered by 888, this was my first actual cash deposit which equated to £12.80. I've played on a few sites and found that 888's software is far more superior and fair compared with the other sites where the ""bad beats"" seem to come round far too frequently bringing the integrity of the sites into question. I recommend 888 to everyone as in my opinion it is the overall best site to game at, offers greater rewards and exciting well structured poker tournaments/cash games in comparison with the other sites I have played on over the years. I hope my review gives you the confidence to come and game at 888 too and I look forward to seeing you at the tables soon. Keep up the amazing work 888!!! Rhys  aka  ""Manny_Hustle""",5

Great software, easy to navigate, professional and helpful support, A wide variety of tournaments. I like to play turbo and super turbo tournaments. No matter what time I log on, there are always some fun tournaments to play. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, but always have fun. I have tried live poker in Macau too, But guess it is just not for me, transportation, long wait time for a seat, pace way too slow and sometimes you run into some unpleasant people and there are too many smokers in China.",5
2013-11-16,Just one the same tournament for the 3rd time. Great software. Good that you now have Snap Poker. You could make the software even better if players could use the mouse to scroll by SB. Also would be good if the rebuys had 15 min blinds rather than 10 mins (it is almost a turbo right now) and more 6 max tournies including smaller buy-in options for them.,4

As for the reply to my review, (it's a game of chance and should be played for fun).

2023-01-27,"I've been happy using Ladbrokes for a year. I only bet £5 a day and am down over the year but not by much. However twice recently Ladbrokes have made errors in odds or settlement and both times they have cost me money, which is poor.The most recent occurrence was on a £10 bet on more than 1.5 goals in an Argentine football match. The bet was cash out enabled. A team scored early and I was in credit on the bet. I decided to keep the bet in until half time to see if a second goal would be scored. When I next looked my bet had settled as a win. Great! I withdrew £15 and rebet my remaining £2.50 on over 2.5 goals at what looked like good odds. The score on Ladbrokes showed as 1-1. That evening I looked again and my account said minus £17.50. How is this possible? It turns out Ladbrokes had made an error and the second goal had never happened. The match had finished 1-0 so in Ladbrokes"" world I had lost. I accept that it's an error but surely you just void the bets on that match? As is they effectively allowed the second bet with money I didn't have and that took me beyond my gambling controls limit. Very poor.",1

2023-01-07,"I have tried to contact ladbrokes about a few problems, but cannot find a live chat or email address anywhere. They simply do not want you contact them. All the bullshine saying there is a live chat option is just that. Lies. Slots that never pay out, they suspend markets when you get a sports bet that goes into profit and have a chance of cashing out, they soon remove that option, i guarantee it. Total con artists and i have written to the gambling commision giving them all my evidence of the dodgy way these scammers run this site. It is run by liars and thieves. Stay away.

2023-01-01,"I agree with everyones reviews, these scammers are ripping everyone off including me, I put in £200 on low bets and had no RTP back at all on multiple slots. Its probably something to do with the winning streak I was on a few weeks back, so if you didn't know when you win alot you'll be ""flagged"" as a problem customer and you'll basically be ""Adjusted"" to lose consistently across multiple platforms, this is how these scammers work. Avoid large branded slots their definetly the worse!",1
2023-01-06,Scamming little f*ckin rats Even their slots are laggy and unplayable if you even start profiting a bit you’ll notice a shift. They rig the odds here trust me. DO NOT GIVE UR MONEY TO THEM how is this legal LMAO?!??!,1

2022-12-29,Worst betting site I have ever used - when you win large sums of money they suspend your betting ability then don’t return your customer care calls - really 2nd class betting site was advised to go online from the betting shop near my house but sadly been unable to bet now since 4pm today and tried several attempts at getting through to numerous customer care numbers emails etc no return calls after being promised Will be leaving the site and will put my complaint in at the betting shop near my house where I go in everyday Useless betting site with no integrity Don’t waste your time,1

2023-01-11,The best thing anyone can do is stop giving ladbrokes or coral your hard earned money. All they will do is take and take and take and not give back anything worth it. That is how it works. They do not care about customers because it is all about the money of course. The RNG is false. The odds do not matter at all. The only way you will be happy is for you to just close your account with them and then they will start losing customers and have no choice but to shut down their companies because they will not be making any money. They are scammers and always have been. Read about why they were fined not once but twice and the second time is a new record. £17Million. Enough said. Just remember it is only you that can stop yourself from making a huge mistake and trust spending your money on these companies that take advantage. Do not give in to any temptation. Be strong everyone. Good luck.,1

So many better companies, some who actually care about their customers. Stay away from Ladbrokes Coral, they will remove bad reviews even though the dislike is clear, they'll blame you for their problems. And they'll make normal bets void. I put £10 on Messi and Mbappe to score in the WC final, it was made void for no reason other than Ladbrokes not wanting to pay out on safe bets.",1

I came on chat and spent 40 minutes with non existent support from Jeffrey. He literally did not speak and just repeated my query back to me for 40 minutes so I escalated to Anabelle and she wasn't any better. The bottom line was that the insurance bet only qualified for the first bet of the day which Jeffrey had no clue about and neither did I. When I asked Anabelle to raise a complaint she just said that she acknowledges it. Nothing to escalate the situation was offered. Rotten customer service support and not for the first time--------------ResponseI did raise a complaint but the response was same as chat, poor",1

2022-12-08,I received a very clear and concise reply to issues I raised regarding the availability of free games. I was directed to terms and conditions which again were clear and easy to understand. Primarily the availability is nothing more than a device to suck the punter into using the app and once this is achieved the availability is quickly and firmly removed. I personally perceive that my loyalty to this multi million company has been abused because I happened to have a very small amount of success,2

I asked for my account to be closed and he offered self-exclusion to which I refused. I said it implied I had a gambling problem and I actually wanted to close account altogether.

2022-12-17,"Had no luck when depositing before so decided to keep up trying with free games and promotions. Won a promotion for 5 free spins and got 10p back which left 21p in account, continued after 5 bonus spins were complete which left me with 2 10p real money spins, got a winning reel with first real money 10p spin and it cut off saying a server error.Left 10p real money in account so loaded another promotion for a free bingo ticket (worth10p) used the last 10p real money to buy another ticket and got a message saying logged out as session was being used with same login? Would have deposited real money more but had problems previously and this has proven the site to be unreliable or untrustworthy. Would not recommend and would advise to use another well known betting app which in my experience has generally been without problems.",1

Not sure about all the other ones but if the table is empty and you place red/black as an example all the sudden the not chosen colour comes up 70+ % of the time. I got so annoyed with this I did close to 100 test bests on 50/50 and some on 80% coverage. They’ll reply with some BS about RNG of course but won’t be held accountable.

2022-11-09,"We all hate losing and our first inclination when we do is to think gambling's rigged. But, in order to make a profit, providers need to have the overall odds in their favour - albeit that there's the potential for individual players to have good sized wins - and they're regulated to make sure there's a fair rate of return. For me, Ladbrokes are one of the most inventive and best out there. I recently had cause to go to customer service and the matter was resolved to my satisfaction. Chat can be clunky, and it took some going around the houses, but we got there in the end. Would recommend Ladbrokes.",4

Would they have paid out more if I had placed a bet, won and later discovered the price was less than it should have been? Most definitely not. I understand mistakes can be made. However, I feel Ladbrokes should own this and allow the bet to stand. If for nothing else, a goodwill gesture for my custom over the years! Several emails and discussions later, I’ve been left with a sour taste in my mouth. Customer service has been shocking and the attitude and lack of understanding and compassion by the operators has left a lot to desire. We’re talking £200 here not £200k!! Anyhow I’ve since closed my account and will take my custom elsewhere. I’d advise anyone thinking of joint Ladbrokes to think again. Look online at their reviews it seems this type of incident is the norm. They are an appalling company who treat their loyal customers like something on the bottom of their shoes. Avoid at all costs. Take your custom and money elsewhere, I’m sure you’ll be more appreciated.",1
2023-01-16,"This might be worth a read as it isn't said in haste or after a loss.I joined the ladbrokes site on line after receiving a number of in shop vouchers to use on slots.Had a couple of little profits so after leaving the terrible sky Vegas I signed up for ladbrokes.Initially I put in 10 pounds as a balance and had a few slot spins that showed a small profit so I was happy.Along came lockdown number 1 and a trivia quiz was on offer twice a day for about a month or so .Regularly picked up prize money of a couple of pounds a day and before long my balance was around the 70 pounds mark.Had a few games on slots for 10p spins and boosted balance to 160 ish pounds.I like a small wager bet on sports and had a number of nice little wins ,never enough to retire on but all little boosts to the balance.Then as a regular weekly trivia player I noticed the live gameshow games in the live casino.So for approx 18 months I regularly took part in the gameshow games,only ever on low stake but continually using my brain to avert any major loss but also picking up nice little wins.By January 18th 2023 I had a balance of 906 pounds.Not bad for 1 deposit of a tenner 3 years ago I think .On Monday last week I couldn't sign into the site and was informed I needed to perform an identification verification check and was talked through the process.I sent all the necessary photo I.d and waited .2 days later I rang for an update and was told I.d had been cleared and account would be back running inside 24 hrs.So 24 hrs later still no sign in allowed and I was then informed by email my I.d.was good and sign in would be enabled in 24 hrs.Again 24 hrs later no sign in allowed so was then informed by email  that the risk security team had took a decision to close my account .Numerous emails sent and not one reply regarding the actual truthful reason for closing my account .Disgusting way to do business and clearly if you are a mug that throws pound after pound their way they will welcome you with open arms but if you slowly but surely build up a balance you are a risk !!!!!!! Every word of this is true and will not be challenged by Ladbrokes because they are too pathetic to be forthright and give a real plausible explanation but choose to hide behind a generic risk team banner and offer no explanation.Shoddy onesided outfit with no guts.Hope this helps anyone in their decision to find a decent site.",1

It wouldn’t let me cash out from the start as it kept saying suspend. Also the scores wouldn’t update, meaning all of the games I betted on had goals, but on ladbrokes all the games is showing as nil-nil. I contacted ladbrokes with picture evidence and this was their response “ I would like to remind you that our Cash Out facility is an added feature. You should never place bets under the assumption that you will be able to Cash Out later.Although we do try to have this on most of our markets, this does not mean it is guaranteed”. So basically if you bet with ladbrokes and they know your bet winning don’t expect to cash out early…scammers.",1

Out of 20 games, the team that was favoured to win, won a grand total of ZERO times. Obviously people would look at this and think that's just part of the game but this form is absolutely disgraceful and makes no sense what so ever and it's blatantly obvious that their system is rigged beyond belief, had i continued watching im sure it would of continued happening but at that point i decided to close my account and be done with this shoddy firm.",1
2022-10-01,Tried to put a bet on a horse at 25/1 for stake of 100 e.w. Was told I could only have 50 e.w maximum. When I confronted shop manager about this his reply was safer gambling for your own good. Which was all well and good. So I was reading the paper in the shop and I kept noticing a gentleman playing FOBT and overheard him spend a total of 800 pounds on his bank card. So I thought before I leave I’ll say to the manager what about safer gambling.and said to him that gentleman lost 800 pounds on his bank card so why didn’t you mention safer gambling to him like you had to me. So all in all these shops will let you do any amount of money on the fixed odds machines but if you fancy a decent punt on a horse at a price it’s on there terms as they don’t want to get caught out. If Ladbrokes reply to this review I know there reply with some phoney excuse. I never go there again.,5
2022-10-08,o had a bad experience with Ladbroke I don’t truth them anymore now every time I place a bet with them I had to check it myself to see if I lost or I won three times they took the money and said it’s losing bet I rang them and told them it’s wining bet then they fixed it like that I have to ring them so if I win they say it’s losing bet and if I lose they take the money so I better stop betting with them but I want to know how many times this happened I never checked before they should give me some money yes I don’t know how much but not $25 dollars bonus bus bet Ladbroke offered me $25 dollars bonus bet because they didn’t wrong what’s that no I don’t want $25 dollars i will keep telling every one about Ladbroke what they did to me to all the people and maybe today I will ring the ombudsman to see if I can get my money back or Ladbroke talk to me and fix this issue before court,1

2023-01-16,Jack at Huntingdon store (pe29)You ain't professional enough to be in the role you are absolutely shocking customer service to the point I lost my cool with the lad as his smirk just got to me. Anyhow jack and his mummy of Huntingdon store what a pair. a pair of lemons and I ain't talking the slot type of lemons. Kicking me out for setting a safe gambling limit came over and demanded my name and that wasn't even good enough for the lad that clearly struggles with every day to day activity. Keep the poxy £70 I put in the machine to kick me out without a valid reason all because I was safe betting. Jack you smirk is unprofessional and making up your own rules to get me out the shop. I didn't think mother and son could work with each other in this kinda business very bias when in a conflict with the pair but none the less Ladbrokes you have lost a customer today from jacks actions. The guy is unbelievable and by far the worst customer care I ever received the guy should be working in Mc Donald's not dictating people's names. Anyhow jack if you ever spoke to me like that out of store I would be sure to put your manners right boy as you need a refresh in customer service and I would gladly give you a lesson in good customer service as seems you struggle with people debating with you when you clearly are wrong anyhow Vicky the other staff member not the mummy of jack you was some what of a help but you could of spoken up and out your college in his place regarding rules and regulations of the store but nope just defended jacks actions which led to one frustrated customer leaving on a bad note. Will not be coming back but hope jack gets the lesson in customer service that is very well needed as this guy single handed will leave a negative look on ladbrokes Huntingdon store and for the record jack I don't care how long you worked there dictating your own rules is not. Kicking someone out £70 in slot games with no excuse because I set my safe gamble limit and didn't wanna give him my name so they could put a name to my face for most likely face detection so they can rinse me even more. Anyhow Jack BOY learn some manners and get a meal you look hungry chap!,1

2022-12-19,"Just played 3 different slots and won bonus free spins on each. Game One = £1.87 from 5 free spins Game Two = £5.50 from 12 free spins and Game Three £0.40 from 10 free spins. Ladbrokes that is a complete and utter joke! From 27 free spins I won less than £8.00. You really are going to be losing customers because I'm going to be closing account very soon also, I'm just sick of the appalling RPT (Return To Player), whenever a bonus is hit, I've had it happen time and time again before today. Fair enough, people can't win the bonus free spins all the time but when they do win they  should be paid a fair and decent amount rather than it be manipulate by you so as you bleed the punter of their money when they're doing the spins and then secondly, pay out as little possible when they hit a bonus. Shame on you! And when I read that some people won the £100 on that free Spin the Wheel game but you didn't honour it that just says it all, you really are lower than low!As per response from Lowbrokes, I'd just like to add, 'Dear Lowbrokes Customer Useless Services - please can you not insult customers with your bog standard, meaningless replies (which are just a copy and pasted script!) If you cannot write a genuine response then please do not bother to write one at all because you're just making yourselves look even more insincere and ridiculous! Don't insult mine or anyone else's intelligence, it's getting really lame now'.",1

Yes 14 months.I have never been in trouble with the police or threatened anyone in my life and here I am being publically shamed with zero evidence, zero witnesses, nothing. This is because they personally didn’t like how I responded to their rudeness and Unprofessionalism , so then they pretend to be the victim and harass me with this ridiculous accusation and public embarrassment and make me feel like I’m some sort of thug.Be careful with these Ladbrokes staff as clearly they’re on some sort of power Trip thinking they’re above the law.I don’t like how they’ve got me on their database like I’m on Crimewatch UK - absolutely disgusting infact and I feel violated.

2022-10-18,DO NOT use this site!!I opened my account in less than a day and that is where my problem started. As soon as I put my card on the site it was downhill from there. For some reason they had the power to now take all my money from my account without me depositing. They drained my account of more than £1400 and they told me it was a software glitch. What kind of software glitch allows money to be drained from you account without your permission or notification. They said I had to deactivate my grid card to stop it happening at my local Ladbrokes. They left me with nothing and even overdrawn. I am paying overdraft fees at no fault of my own. It has been over a month and they have been sending me vague emails about having trouble reopening my account after they blocked it. They said they blocked it to fix it and return money. They have kept it blocked for a month. They are holding my money hostage. I was almost homeless because of this glitch. I am still battling with them to get my account open and to get my money back. They send you round and round and give you false timelines. They are thieves. Go elsewhere. They will rob you and leave you for dead.,1

2022-11-01,"Pathetic the way they treat customers.I’ve been a casual gambler on sports and casino for a little while on Ladbrokes. It was all fine for a while. I got offered a “Spend £10 in casino and get £50 bonus to play with” which had a 40x wagering requirement. I’m fine with the wagering, I understand why they do it. So anyway, I got lucky on slots and by the time I’d done my wagering of £2,000 (40x the £50 bonus), I came away with £600 withdrawable cash. But I decided to have some more fun with it on Live Casino. I ended up with £1,300.My account then suddenly gets restricted. I contact support to see what the problem is, and they say they are doing a “standard security check”, and email me requesting some ID documents. So I oblige, I send them in and all seemed dandy. And then in comes an email saying my account is being blocked. No reasons, just “a business decision” was made. I managed to get the money withdrawn, but am no longer able to use their site, or any others in the Entain group.They’ve made me feel like I’ve done something criminal, which is ironic being made to feel that way because of a gambling site… some of the biggest crooks out there (screen-record a few spins of any roulette spin and watch it in slow motion… the ball defies the laws of physics, it’s such blatant manipulation! But I digress…). Anyway, I’ve No idea what made them come to that “business decision”, other than I made a small bit of cash from their promotional offer and they don’t like when the consumer benefits. Don’t offer these promotions if you don’t like people winning from them.Absolutely pathetic, as is the customer support. No doubt I’ll get the stock “please email support and we’ll do our best to help you” response to this review (if I get one at all), and that will just result in the same replies from the poor suckers in the call centre saying they don’t know why the “business decisions” are made.Avoid at all costs!",1

2022-12-14,"Since writing this review about the appalling customer service at Entain I have recieved a cut and paste reply suggesting I contact their customer service team. You couldn't make it up! It's actually quite amusing 😄.In terms of my original complaint this has now been settled but only because I didn't have the inclination to keep dealing with them. In a way it's been a good thing in that the experience has encouraged me to shop around and I now realise there are better alternatives. My spend with Entain will dramatically decrease going forward and that's only because Coral/Ladbrokes shops is on my doorstep otherwise I'd quit them all together.23/1/23I cannot recommend that anybody risk gaming at Ladbrokes (Entain).This once quite reputable company's customer care is appalling.There has been a marked deterioration in the quality of their service.In the increasingly likely event you have to contact them regarding some glitch or other problem you will find that their customer care team don't really care. They will issue no end of cut-and-paste apologies but will do very little if anything to resolve the problem. This is presumably in the hope you will get exasperated and throw in the towel.I've recently submitted a complaint and they have missed the three target dates that they gave me by which the would respond. When I complained they just say 'there is nothing we can do' they then, yet again advise me that it will be 24-72hrs...'your patience is appreciated...' and then ignore their own deadline again.What worries me most is I suspect, and it is only a suspicion, that they are now deploying petty dishonesties in dealing with my matter. I suspect a fabricated copy email was cobbled together to provide me with proof that my complaint had been acknowledged...it's contents didn't ring true and was not quite in house style. In any event, I never recieved it directly even by the time of writing this.I eventually spoke on chat with a supervisor named 'Jake' who apologised profusely and asked me to give it yet another 72hrs whereupon if I still had not recieved a reply he (in terms) would take the matter up personally. When I contacted 72hrs later Jake was not on shift, I was requested to give it a further 72hrs....with the usual and by now maddening meaningless apologies. I insisted this couldn't go on and was asked if I would like the matter referred to the shift supervisor 'Emma' I said I would but only with the assurance that she read the now quite lengthy thread detailing the saga. I did this for obvious reasons. Emma replied with the now trite usual apologies and reassured me that she had read and understood the thread....and then referred to me by the wrong name! She used my twitter handle....and asked me to give it 24-72hrs!!Now here's the thing...in that thread I am throughout referred to by my actual name...the name on my account except on one occasion when I correct the person and they apologise. I'm not offended at being misnamed I'm annoyed that in misnaming me she exposed that her claim to have read the thread was untruthful. It could not have escaped anyone reading it what my actual name is.I have submitted a further complaint and am advised to wait 20 days this time!...At this point I have no confidence in the integrity of the process and don't actually expect to hear from them.It's either deliberate at this point or the state of affairs at back-office Entain is abysmal. Either way, it's a bad look.Today I opened two accounts with alternate non-Entain bookies...they can have my custom going forward.I hope this helps.",1
2022-11-15,"This company Ladbrokes and their sister company Coral are Disgustingly Unfair to UK Punters through their corrupt FOBT offerings and it is high time that Bacta, The UK Gambling Commission and HM Government got their collective acts together and actually finally came down very hard on these organisations to severely scrutinize both their historic and current activities related to the set up and operation of this type of hardware.I am making a stand on behalf of all the people of the UK who have fallen victim to these machines in some way because these companies have stolen £1,000,000's upon £1,000,000's from Punters across our country over countless years, and much worse - illegally in my opinion, by robbing Punters of what should be a legally enforced 'fair chance' related to breaches of the rules and regulations of both BACTA and The UK Gambling Commission.I have personally lost over £100K to their FOBT offerings over the past 10+ years of my life and at no point do I feel that I have had a fair chance to win, or indeed that the games were performing anywhere close to the promised advertised 'return to player percentages' listed within the game information on each unit. Statistically I have easily had over 1,000 independent gaming sessions on the machines in these shops playing on all denominations and stakes and in all that volume of 'data' from which to draw conclusions, I have only ever had one single £500 win.Honestly, the appallingly unfair behaviours I have seen and witnessed many times over first hand from these machines during both my own large number of sessions and of those from other 'customers' are so bad they literally have to be seen to be believed. These disgustingly unfair FOBT's trot out the same losing patterns and ridiculously low win bonus games again and again with a seemingly eternal and monotonous repetition no matter the play stake, it never ceases to shock and amaze me how blatantly and continuously unfair they are prepared to be in order to syphon off all of a 'customers' money as quickly as electronically possible, what I have witnessed cannot be described as anything even close to fairness . . . indeed the most accurate descriptive terms I could use can only be 'pure greed' and 'evil'.If I had recorded all of my gaming sessions on the many units in these shops and played them to a jury in a court of law, although obviously impractical (as it would take a very long time to watch through), the jury could be left in no doubt whatsoever how illegal these machines are performing in reality on a daily, weekly and yearly basis, the volume of evidence would be as 'Massive' in its entirety as it would be 'Damning' in its Nature, the blatant corruption would be Glaringly Obvious for All to see.Consider now that 'I' am just one victim of many thousands of people that these companies have exploited nationally to facilitate for themselves 'Huge Financial Gains' through this machinery of corruption, indeed these companies have preyed upon our public nationally on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for year after crushing year, and how much money have they literally wrenched away from otherwise good people and more importantly from 'families financial lives' - there is no doubt that peoples wellbeing has suffered substantially as a direct result of these companies deplorable activities.Knowing what I know 'for certain' through relentless and bitter bad experinces at the hands of these shops I feel absolutely and essentially 'obligated' to highlight and expose the level of unfairness in continual and perpetual practice because what these companies are doing is wrong on 'every single level' possible, they are plying a very vile and evil trade which has literally left many thousands of people broken and destitute - people who've taken the information provided from the machines on face value and played in good faith but who have then been systematically and financially demolished and more importantly completely and flagrantly denied a 'fair chance' to win . . . for want of a less offensive term 'mugged' in broad daylight by supposedly 'legitimate companies'.UK Government continues to 'tolerate' this sick trade within Society which quite frankly is disgusting, the only defence I can muster for them is that they may not truly know the full picture with regard to the level of unfairness and corruption occurring daily on the high street within these two companies shops . . . but they certainly know how profitable these machines are on the whole, the link there is a conflict of interests on a grand and unnacceptable scale because public Gambling losses should never be a legitimate source of income for any Government in my opinion, probably the very same opinion that most families up and down the UK would have, Amen.",1

2022-09-07,Well just got my reply from 3 days ago after Ladrokes asked me to contact them. I am not eligible for any free promotions that are advertised in my ladbrokes acvount or on the app due to the 7.7 ladrokes terms and conditions that they can restrict my account on all deposits and withdrawals going forward as well as restricting or blocking me from all promotions. Must of because I won a few times and withdrew my money. Funny that's what I thought betting was all about whether be on a free promotion or from money I deposited. Will run my account down and stick with other sites now.,1

I let Ladbrokes know and asked how the payment could have been approved if my details didn't match.  My bank flags a warning if I try to set up a payment to someone if their name or other details aren't right, so surely it would be same for payments made by Ladbrokes.  Ladbrokes customer support confirmed that it shouldn't have been authorised if my details didn't match and they told me they would take it up with their provider.  That was in March 2022 and I'm still waiting 6 months later. Every time I contact them, they tell me to give them more time. Even to the point of saying don't call us we'll call you.

2022-09-02,"Your money is not secure with ladbrokes NEVER DEPOSIT THERE AS THERE IS A THREAT THAT THEY WILL STEAL THE BALANCE WITHOUT NOTICE. they literally stole $90 by suspending my account which i had in ladbrokes tournament dollars or whatever they are called. I also have a pending withdrawal of just under £100 which may also be under threat, i have not had confirmation of it being paid as yet (the account was saying this whole balance was withdrawable). I know you are probably thinking there must be a reason like cheating or something underhanded, but for about 4 or 5 years i used them regularly at least once per week, regular deposits and some withdrawals all with no issue, some i won on and some i lost, but all on my own account and i am not one of those people who thinks it must be rigged just because i go on a losing streak, no other accounts used, using my own bank account for deposits and withdrawals and they had copies of my passport for verification, I am also in my 40s so far from underage.I log in one day and have a free bet, i go to use the bet and it advises that account suspended, so I speak with their online chat and they confirm the suspension and something along the lines of 'very sorry but this is an irreversable decision', obviously i told them where to go! What are they gonna do, ban me? confiscate my balance? they have already done this.I received no email, no notification or any reason as to why.... Just banned.I am unable to access the poker client, the casino or the sports book, all just locked out and told to contact support.So thats it.... they just suddenly ban your account and steal the balance without any explanation or reason, cant be bothered to advise you of this and treat their depositors like something from the sole of their shoe.This is either really shady behaviour from a supposedly well established gambling site or terrible customer service. either way this is super shady and they may scam you out of your balance.IN SUMMARY, MY ACCOUNT HAD A LEGITIMATELY EARNED BALANCE AND THEY SUSPENDED IT AND CONFISCATED IT FOR NO OBVIOUS REASON OR BREACH OF THEIR T&CS, ALL WITHOUT ANY EMAIL OR NOTIFICATION.FOR THE LADBROKES REP RESPONDING TO ALL THESE GRIPES. YOUR GENERIC FOBBING OFF OF WANTING TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER IS POINTLESS, YOU ARE JUST A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WITH NO POWER, AND YES, I KNOW I CAN CONTACT YOU ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS.

We expect better and consumers deserve better.""In a statement, Entain said it had agreed to the settlement ""to bring the matter to a close"" and ""avoid further costly and protracted legal proceedings"".It added the issues raised related ""to the period between December 2019 and October 2020, which predates the many changes in the area of safer gambling and anti-money laundering that Entain has introduced"".",1

I asked for an explanation why I hadn’t won as nowhere on my betting slip did it specify the win had to occur in the first 90 minutes. The guy behind the counter wouldn’t explain any further because he knew I was right. I’m a young woman who rarely bets and being laughed at by the man behind the counter is quite frankly rude and disgraceful customer service. T&c’s should be clearly explained when a bet is placed.

Now there are 18 different piano keys to choose from yet before I have picked one the amount I've won is already showing that cant be possible because the RNG should have no idea which key I will choose when there are so many different variables of which I pick and in what order Proving it is fixed .Wish upon a jackpot: fairy godmother slides across the screen and before it has stopped for me to even pick between the 3 symbols I already know what I have won yet another prime example King kong jackpot : exactly the same happens , second lowest bonus you choose the barrels to climb the ladder and it knows which symbol your choosing cos winnings are showing before u start I have the screenshots to prove all this !",1

However, there may be occasions where a gambling business can only ask you for information at that time in order to fulfil legal obligations.If a gambling business needs more information before you can withdraw your funds, for example, for anti-money laundering checks, then they should ask promptly and not only when you want to withdraw your funds.Where a gambling business delays a request to withdraw funds due to insufficient ID, they may be in breach of Licence Condition 17 – Customer identity verification and may be subject to regulatory action.",1

By very well I mean up by maybe £25 pounds at most over an hr. I was getting lots of free spins and having fun. Suddenly get a error message on screen and when I log out then back in the game looks different, it's subtle but it has changed. After 10 mins, zero free spins and £15 down I realise what happened. Don't take us for mugs Ladbrokes, the games are fixed. We can accept this, I could have walked away £25 up and happy. Its the lies that put me off. It pisses me right off when any company I'm giving money too has zero respect for my custom. Maybe small time gamblers don't matter a fig to you but we make up a very large portion of your profits. You won't miss my bets of a few hundred pounds a year and I won't miss your deceit. I was prepared to accept your crap about the computer generated play until I saw the deceit with my own eyes.

People behind the counter can see the % that shop has taken and each machine so please ladrooks tell me how this is random.,1
2022-06-03,"This month seems to be a collecting month for them and looking at the recent reviews it proves it. Trading standards will jump in soon. Plus It isn't as random as they pretend it is, the win rates can be varied. I kept giving it a chance and 4 days in a row it just swallowed my money not even a little bit back to keep playing abit. I'll be moving on to a different app because this is a joke now.    Ps. don't bother leaving your scripted bulls*** reply.",1

2022-05-13,Bet over a thousand pound in the last 3 months. Have won hardly anything back. Always play bonanza usually the bonus will drop after a while. It does on other sites but ladbrokes bonanza is not dropping any bonuses. I've been playing it nearly every day for weeks and only today the bonus drop and I thought great im going to get a big win but it only gave me back nearly £60. Its just spin after spin. Now I dont no weather to leave ladbrokes or carry on hopefully it will pay out 😔,1

2022-05-12,I started Ladbrokes recently and ive only bet on sports which is what everyone should be doing not wasting their money on rigged casino spins and then complaining about it. I have won a lot of money from betting on sports like football for all gambling apps.,4
2022-05-11,"Spent the last £1 ever on this site,absolutely shocking,I play 3 other well know sites and this is beyond the worst,if it's a random generator the same as other sites why is it only yours that rarely if ever gives you a bonus round.

2022-05-07,"Play small amounts on slot machines. I have had good wins on Lord of the Rings, Dougs Nuggets and Eye of Horus. I only put a max fiver in and play 20 p game. Moderation is key to gambling and sticking to a budget. Never chase money. It is a very fast runner.",5
2022-05-06,"Zero stars would be more appropriate. Just today played over £80 (50p games) in slingo.... Won £2.50!!! Absolutely disgusting. This is everyday. I know what they think RTP means, but in my humble opinion I'd say it stands for rip the p***!!! This site has systematically taken every single penny I've put in (trust me it's hundreds this last month) and gave dick all in return. Same winners doesn't matter what room you play in. As for their sister sites, well all the sites are merged, so even if you jump to coral/gala or foxy it's still the same soddin winners. How can they possibly claim its random when there's 800 players in one room and the same bloody names pop up at least once an hour. It's disgusting. The chat hosts tell you to buy your tickets and hope for the best, that in itself is terrible.... Encouraging gamblers to spend more money?! Hardly responsible. I'm absolutely furious looking at my deposits and seeing what I've banked.... Pennies in comparison. This site needs shutting down, because all its doing is leaving people in debt. We're told not to play on if our luck isn't there, then I'm flabbergasted as to how they have any players (apart from of course their favourites who win on repeat) I've tried to get something back from these robbing gits but the games play the same day in day out and it's scandalous the money they are taking and not giving folk anything back. I'm disgusted with myself for endorsing this rigged site. Just wondering when the gambling commission will actually act on these sites and stop people from destroying their lives in the hope of a bit money back?? I hope they are shut down. No wonder they're a multimillion pound company when they are blatantly robbing people blind. They ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, and the chat hosts should be too, being associated with these utter scumbags!!! Might aswell open the window and throw my money out onto the street. Scandalous",1

2022-04-29,Ladbrokes have just taken money from my bank 3 weeks after depositing. Apparently they had a technical issue so despite immediate banking despite the new authorising via mob banking app they f***kd up but I now pay the price.   Having seen the payments as pending they did not notify of the problem and 3 weeks later took funds putting me into an overdraft I don’t have! Taking no responsibility. Disgraceful company. No apology no giving notice of retaking payment.  Gives you no chance.   Why bother verifying on banking app if they take it weeks later.  AND you can’t even contact them easily …… now I know why.  DO NOT RELY ON THEM TAKING YOUR DEPSOITS WHEN THEY SAY THEY WILL.  Best not to use at all. Wish I hadn’t even tried them.,1
2022-04-29,"I’ve played with Ladbrokes for years and had wins and losses, but these past months it’s become absolutely dismal.

They say when the fun stops then stop, so I’m not wasting anymore money with scammers.",1

My advise is never ever play any online slots as the games are totally rigged and the very same games are across all betting companies and in my opinion they should all be investigated for what is colluding and money harvesting. They closed my account just because i complained about slots and their free spins enticement which drew me in to losing money, Dirty company nowerdays like all these bookmakers, They are all just casinos online colluding together to harvest money with these games.Avoid.",1

Surly the above tells you the slots are rigged?,1
2022-04-23,When they reply to you by email calling you unknown and not by my name in an email you then know there is no point and nothing is being listened to or will ever be dealt with. All I wanted was to change my email address yet seems beyond this company. Live chat useless as is support and documents email agents who kept on saying it was one or the other who dealt with it.

Everyone's account is on percentage payout and is set up to pay from big to small however hecsaid there are No jackpots and he max someone can win is 3k.

The past week I have taken into consideration that Ladbrokes are absolutely disgusting casino . Their customers service is absolutely crap, no help what's so ever, all they do if you have a problem push you aside to support. The problem I had was last Friday I was winning on the game BIG BASS BONANZA, MUSTANG GOLD, The round White arrowed spinning button that you press to spin decided to not allow me to stop the reels when I wanted . As before I was able to stop the reels via the spinning button. I have played other sites and they give you the chance in DEMO MODE to try out the game's , now we all know that playing a DEMO MODE Your not going to win and that you CAN'T stop the spinning button as it's a DEMO MODE GAME , well since Friday all of the games I've played are the very same as in DEMO MODE. I was told by customer service to send on a video to SUPPOR I have sent numerous emails and videos of the problem and still know reply from SUPPORT.

This is meant to be a word of warning for anybody considering applying for a job in one of Ladbroke/Coral shops after my interview experience...No longer a traditional high street bookmaker, just an amusement arcade for problem gamblers.  A sad place to work and management expect you to keep pushing new ways for customers to lose their cash. Long gone are the days when staff were knowledgeable about horse racing or football and would engage customers in conversation about sport. It appears it's all about getting the customers to play the fixed odds terminals and numbers games as this guarantees the business huge profits regardless of the damage it does to those punters unfortunate enough to become addicted. Their slogan should read ""When the fun stops ours begins"". If you have a conscience then this really is not for you and minimum wage to sell your soul.",1

2022-03-16,"Just went into a Ladbrokes hook Surrey.I really don’t mind losing but when you play on the Ladbrokes roulette machines they play so obvious and they do the opposite to where you bet on, a complete con.FIXED",1
2022-03-15,"On 09/02/2022 I added a new payment method to my Ladbrokes account which I have used to deposit a total sum of £24,885.00, and withdrawn £15300.00, giving a net total deposit using this card of £9585.00.This card was my son’s card, not mine. It only came to my attention on 8th March 2022 that I wasn’t allowed to do this on your site, so I informed you straight away.I appreciate now that it is in your terms and conditions that I should only use payment methods belonging to myself, however I feel Ladbrokes are just as much to blame as I am in the fact that they haven’t ever picked up on the fact that it wasn’t my card. There has been a total of 291 transactions in and out using this card, so this is massive failure on Ladbrokes part that this hasn’t been picked up on.I sent a copy of the card to Ladbrokes and got a response saying the card had been blocked from the account, fair enough, I wouldn’t have used it again anyway.I then requested that the net deposits be returned to my son’s card as this should not have been accepted as a payment method. I know that if I had won say £30,000.00 then you would have realized then and not paid me my winnings, but you would have returned my deposits to me as you shouldn’t have accepted them. So, this is in fact the exact same principal, just because I don’t have any winnings sat in my account you have still accepted payment from a method that wasn’t mine so these deposits should be returned. It seems Ladbrokes just pick and choose what they want to do, If I had won £30,000.00 you wouldn’t have given me it, you’d have given me my deposits back because that is more beneficial to you. Ladbrokes responded to say I wouldn’t get a refund and that I must use my own payment methods in future. I then tried to logon to my account, but it wouldn’t let me. So, I went onto the online chat to be told my account had been closed. I have had no correspondence telling me that this was happening or the reason why? Obviously just because I asked for a refund because before I asked for this, you were happy for me to keep my account if I used my own payment methods.I request you refund me the net deposits on this card of £9585.00 otherwise I will have no option but to take this further.",1
2022-03-15,would give it less than 1 star if i could zero chance of winning really am down more than 400 net deposits this month . spun the dog house slot for more than 300 quid 80p a spins no bonus they say its random number genrator and all that b.s but when the machine starts lagging a teases you multiple muiltple times on a bonus you know something sketchy is going on they used to be a decent online casino but them and there brother coral have went down hill majorily avoid at all cost you will always lose with them,1
2022-03-14,"After 650+ spins on their slot game I did not get one win over £5, the game feature never landed once and there comes a point when random and fairness stop and game rigging start - I crossed that threshold - no representative of Ladbrokes will ever be able to change my mind about how fair their games are. It is organised crime with a license to steal. Highwayman leave you with the means to get home, these guys take the horse and cart - avoid at all cost.",1
2022-03-14,Problems on labrokes for a few days today my virtual sports bet won 3-1 at odds of 18-1 put 20 pounds on bet and when it froze logged back in my bet was void scamming c@#$£¥ and when I asked for my money (winnings) they told me I have to wait for my minimum stake back this is not good enough for a betting site I think I deserve a good wheel gesture at least when I asked for one they said I'm not eligible for one are they kidding me or what,1
2022-03-13,I've left the site if you want a legit site join butlers bingo,1
2022-03-12,It’s the worst betting site ! You can put in 100s and get very little back - there’s no perks anymore ! The daily spin makes me laugh - why have a £100 option on there when no one wins it - surely that’s fraud,1
2022-03-12,Scam didn't refund my try scorer even though he played less than 2min of game.  All other services eg sb and bet365 voided bets,1
2022-03-11,"0 chance of winning anything it’s a total scam playing online, I don’t know how it’s not illegal robbing people every second these days, you’ve got more chance winning the lottery than a £10 profit from these con artists. UPDATE!! To the reply a game of chance means that you actually have a chance, on Ladbrokes people have 0 chance and that’s a fact hence why I’m surprised your not banned and shut down for robbing peoples money making them believe they have a chance like in your response to my review",1
2022-03-11,Never known  a site like it for going down.,1
2022-03-11,"The last few weeks with Ladbrokes and especially Coral have been absolutely horrific (same company) there has definitely been a downturn in Fairness since the Cost Of Living Crisis worsened. The Payouts are nowhere near as good, dead spin central on the games, and no chance of being up up on a deposit. My net deposits on Coral went from £160 over the last 4 years (which shows how fair they used to be) to £600 within the last 30 days, most stake I ever play with is £0.50 and that's a rarity. Similar story on Ladbrokes, however since I'd spent most of my spare money on Coral, I didn't have as much left to lose.You explain to them how different the gameplay is to normal and all you get is the same old pre written nonsense, regarding RNG without them ever looking into your account activity.Gambling is a Risk we all know that, however most regular players will be able to tell if a Casino are doing them over and the moment you definitely are Ladbroke/Coral.Very disappointed in this company at the moment. Normally I would be happy to put my money in as I knew that eventually I would win most of it back, that is certainly not the case at the moment.",2
2022-03-09,The gaming machines are set to pay out the minimum amount required by gaming law. Shareholders have bid demands and there are less shops now.you gave more chance winning the lottery than ending up ahead.just stop gambling on the machines and you have a chance of winning.,1

2022-03-08,"I go to ladbrokes a lot. The past 4-5 months put in thousands and not one day have I been up. At most probably 40-60 pounds. Bonuses don’t pay nothing like before. Completely dead spins. All features on all games paying nothing. All gambles if u get any pay less than the winnings you gambled on.  I’ve had enough. From this day forward I’m done and have also self excluded Everywhere because there just isn’t any point. Online is actually worse. There’s no fun nomore there’s no decent winnings just frustrating every single time. Ladbrokes, don’t reply by sayin it’s all by chance etc when the fun stops stop all that bull, I don’t wana hear non of that. It’s easy to see how things have changed. Gambling everywhere is the same now, nothing like before all your doing is messing people up. I’m lucky I quit today, it’s your loss, financially I’m good but I’d rather not spend another penny on any form of gambling and I’m glad I have excluded for 5 years. I would tell anyone who gambles just STOP. It’s not worth the time and money. You will not gain nothing. Gambling is nothing like before. I see people regularly everyday losing so much money where as I used to see smiles on people’s faces. How things have changed. I urge people to stop going going bookies and stop gambling, if you have any problems go seek help.",1

No idea how i could have been fraudulent, they take money out of an account, you win most of your money back and request to put the winnings (at a loss) back into the same account they took it from is somehow suspicious?!?

2022-02-15,"I am a small time depositor as I only deposit what I can afford to lose, no matter how tempting it may be, plain, simple,  and effective. Here I base my review on my small time gambling experience, and that is overall a good one. The casino offers a number of ways to be involved in free play as well as being constantly stacked with various wagering/deposit promotions which are good; these are also a feature in the sport betting section. I have enjoyed a few withdrawals too, therefore extra brownie points for this!However, and while I am aware that the Live Casino Gaming are platforms linked to a number of casinos, I really think that Ladbroke could implement a system by which the customers accessing these games from Ladbroke and that are hurling, misogynistic, homophobic, racist abuse are removed not just from chat, but banned from the casino all together. I used to enjoy taking part in the daily Live Casino competition, but today has definitely been the last time as the language used towards the female host, is by the law of the land, criminal, it can and in most arenas is prosecuted.One can ignore the chat but the trolls would just thrive. There's a urgent need to give more enforcing power to the moderators of the chat facilities. Where an insult is of criminal nature, these players disguised by numbers should be held accountable in accordance with the laws of their respective countries. Last but not least, the overall sentiment seems to be related to enduring conspiracies about breaks to wheels, rigged this, rigged that and so on. Aren't these red flags narratives of addiction? Isn't the relentless denial of Random Generation yet another red flag attitude that should be assessed and where appropriate account closure enforced?I repeat, I am aware that Ladbroke cannot be responsible for players of other casinos, but it would be an act of integrity and candour to enforce discipline with own players.",4

2022-01-09,"I would give this company a 0 stars if I could. I've never had so many issues with a betting company ever, I have been with them 1 day (after rejoining them from previous years) and I wish I never bothered.

2022-01-09,"Hi, I'm often very lucky with poker (my 'in the flesh' poker peers say I'm very good 😳) however the spin poker smells more fishy than Grimsby Docks! I'm far from a sore loser - I take it on the chin ALWAYS - nor am I a cheat. Played MANY times at different times on the 24 hour clock and simply not convinced its real people playing (if they are, they are in cahoots with each other) and / or random cards being dealt in any random order.",1
2022-01-06,"So, I emailed this company several times raising a few concerns I had with bets that I had struck and tried to strike. Continuous email replies referring me to their general rules. Asking for my email to be escalated to a manager and ""please stop referring me back to general rules"" , the next reply tells me to go general rules as this may help. Also I have deleted card details 3 months ago and alarmingly having made a withdrawal they split it to my registered card but also to the card which was deleted , I was told to contact my bank 11 times by different customer service agents when I asked why the card details were still being used after I deleted it, their only trained to give robotic like responses . Disgusting customer service which has quite obviously been out sourced to people that have not got a clue. ACCOUNT CLOSED , NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY.",1
2022-01-05,"Probably the most awful gambling site you can play. I’ve been playing slots for a very long time, I then became win blocked by Ladbrokes what this means is you won’t ever win, they like to say there games are all random blah blah blah it’s incorrect. Once your at a certain point up, every single thing you put on will be taken. For 3 months I’ve uploaded £200 as they decided to put a cap on my account. I play only 1 game. Please inform me how every month £200 each time I loose.. I loose every penny and win nothing back. These places are designed to make money, don’t fall for it for the adverts or the promotions. You will never win. I’m all about fair game and I don’t mind loosing ever so often, but it’s completely impossible to loose that many times if it’s random unless something is applied to your account. My friend won £500 on the game I play, she then uploaded £800 what happened? She lost every penny. Please use someone more trust worthy. Paddy power is absolutely excellent. Don’t waste your money on these fools.",1

But if that was the case, why would you let me open another account? Why would you accept my deposits and also been playing on the site for about 4 days.Why did this happen in the exact moment I managed to make a withdrawal?And what's gonna happen to my winnings?

Since then which was 6 days ago sporting bet has said that they have sent numerous requests to the payment team which is ladbrookes to approve the withdrawal.

2021-12-23,"Went to ladbrokes to day had a very unpleasant experience just like the last time I went In , thinking about it just like every time I go in to any ladbrokes in any city always the same . Stinks like urine - after legally Frauding hardworking people every day all day every week all year they could at least sort the drainage issues out so you can at least breath while chucking your hard earned cash down there throat . What’s happened to your fobt? Well I guess the clues in the name- FIXED odds betting terminals - I have again wasted 200 quid just before Xmas chasing a feature that is just not available to gain or win acquire what ever you want to say . Next to me I watched a man play 2 quid a spin eye of Horus 350 spins later and 700 buff down even he didn’t get a feature . What the fudge is happened to you man . The games that people played and won have been altered eg roulette . Your legal fraudsters, con artists in red t  shirts , I don’t get how you can sleep at night working for them or promoting there efforts towards fair gambling . 99 percent of the people in there are annoyed after being blatantly robbed of there money . The features are bloody poor when you do get them . These machines are crack cocaine of the high street and all these shops need bulldozing . Ladbrokes you should be ashamed of your selfs greedy greedy people . I’ve self excluded from all ladbrokes but can still just wonder in and waste my money what’s the point in self exclusion if no one cares . But if I was to win - fat chance of that but if I was they would come running saying I’m barred . Very bad company out to pull the wool over your eyes flash some lights in your face and take your hard earned cash they don’t care . They cannot even pay their staff there bad bad bad people .

I was asking for clarification.Ladbrokes team responded by telling me that it's possible to lose when playing (Duh, I am used to gambling, it's mostly losing) and without even telling me, closed down my account without warning or explanation after the fact.When I contacted them again to ask for an apology and reopening my account, they seemed to think I was apologising to them (For what? Raising a genuine concern?) and that I'd have to wait 5+ months for reactivation.Thoroughly unimpressed.",1

More than £1.00) out of a full £25 just swallowed my money, even tried a new game & that was the same…… not even 1 big banker, we thought it was my account as I’ve only just signed up & ive only deposited £130 and had no withdrawals as I’ve never won any money. So we deposit another £10 on my boyfriends account & it was the exact same just swallowed the money not 1 big banker between us!!!!!! Absolutely Scandalous",1
2021-12-01,Ladbrokes closed my account within hours of it having been opened one week ago. There was a balance of £63. Now after a week of protracted correspondence they advise there is a nil balance. So effectively like magic the money has disappeared. Plain and simply fraudsters.,1

2021-11-26,Joined years ago but use it occassionally  if they are giving better odds on football. Nothing has changed with Ladbrokes.. slower than a tortoise because they have a market in everything and anything and is a painful experience  putting a bet in. One example. I bet two hoses in the same race . And got messages rapid because my horses were being bet and the price decreasing .race was off. One of my horses one at 16-1 but didn't get on it because Ladbrokes  are the gambling industries sick joke . BET 365 is marginally  better but I have had hassle with them . To. Skybet are far and away the best  . I wouldnt give Ladbrokes 1 star if I was rating them. Minus 5,1
2021-11-26,The worst online slot.Got a message from Ladbrokes to get into the Mega Mode up to 48 Free Spins.I deposited £10 and it prompted me to play Goonies in order to activate Mega Mode. I didn't even get one bonus let alone get into the Mega Mode. Beware they just want customers to spend by advertising the Mega Mode and give nothing back!I have played on Sky Vegas and I have never spent £10 and get 60p total win! Ladbrokes are thieves,1

2021-11-20,"Don't bet with Ladbrokes or Coral (same company), they lie about scores on their cash out offers. They told me a score was 1-1 on the 91st minute and I needed the home side win, they offered me my stake back so I took it. I checked on the score later and it was 2-1, the 2nd winning goal was scored on the 87th minute so Ladbrokes lied/did not tell me the correct score to cut their losses and get people to cash out. I confronted them about this and they said 'we cannot guarantee we will display the correct score when offering a cash out offers'. Disgraceful, they are con men. Use any other betting company that isn't Ladbrokes/Coral",1

Phoned customer service immediately to be told that without a screen shot as proof they can do nothing all they wanted to do was get me off the phone bunch of con merchants  it's not like it was a massive prize of hundreds of thousands or millions in a jackpot it was a free promotion that I won but because I can't prove it as they can't see it on there systems because they don't have access to it they have told me it's my fault I didn't take a screen shot and will not be paying me or investigating it. All they wanted was to get me off the phone spoke to 2 different people and both blamed me apparently you have to take a screen shot when you win on any game as proof if anything is wrong.

Gamstop have no record of me?If I was self excluded why did they allow multiple deposits and a smaller withdrawal? Customer service will not answer me if my withdrawal will be processed. Looks like I'm going to have to take the issue up with the gambling commission and a small claims court case. Not worth the fuss.UPDATE 30/11/2021Still refusing to pay out my winnings, finally managed to get the case escalated to a case manager who will now take 28 further days to review and make a decision. It's ridiculous that they can claim self exclusion not provide any details or proof and just fob you off as if you will leave them keep the money. Looks like a court case will be the only way.UPDATE 04/12/2021 Still refusing to pay winnings. Finally given to the details to contact IBAS to settle this.

Cashed out and I was wondering why it was taking so long to come into my account and then I tried to check and it said my account had been suspended.

2021-10-30,"Date of experience: October 30, 2021",1
2021-10-27,"Like many others that have left a review about Ladbrokes I also believe them to be a scam on their slots. I play Eye of Horus jackpot king. I usually put on £10 and play @10p per spin. That's 100 spins. I may be lucky and win upto about £2(usually in 20p, 40p wins) so that would be around 120 spins overall. The 'scatter' bonus round rarely comes round...if at all! and the jackpot king round is even rarer. Maybe I'm just unlucky but, over the last week I put in £60 (4×£10 and 1×£20). That's 600 spins + small wins equal to around 650 spins in total. Not once did the full jackpot king bonus round appear...except for twice coming in at 3 reels. And I had 3 'scatter' rounds I total over 650+ spins. 1 scatter round payed 20p(the win for getting the scatter!), 1 had £1.60 win(only on small wins with 3 extra spins awarded) and the last one had a £5.60 win. This is not random, it seems to me this is deliberate! Out of 650 spins+ the bonus 'scatter' round only came 3 times and the jackpot king full bonus never came at all(just 2 at 3 reels). Ladbrokes say all there slots are independently verified, but how often are they 'verified'? Every week, every month, every year, every 2 years, every 5 years? Do they get a notified when the slots are going to be 'verified'? Seems to me it would be easy to 'fiddle' the RTP and quickly change them when they are about to be 'independently verified' if they are pre-warned. It would certainly explain why so many people playing the slots say exactly the same...small wins and very few bonus rounds. No wonder the jackpot king is now over 6 million pounds....because it so rarely comes up no one gets the chance to win!",1

2021-10-23,"If I could give it zero I wouldPlaced a bet on the Man City and Brighton match, total goals3 options givenNumber of goals /over /under in total1.5.       Odds given2.5.       Odds givenI picked 2nd half over 1.5 goals, checked the bet before placing, clearly stated I was betting on over 1.5 goals in the 2nd half of the match. I clicked okay, looked at my bet slipOver 1.5 goals Brighton, in the 2nd halfI hadn’t added the Brighton bit.I cashed out as soon as I re read the bet, I never agreed to Brighton scoring 2 goalsI then go through all this againTotal goals, 2nd half over 1.5 goals Re read the bet, place it, this time after making double sure I hadn’t added a team. I left the bet cooked tea then came in with about 5 minutes remaining to see Brighton had scored a penalty, thought great I’ll see what the cash out is £1.30 from betting £45, thought very strange for a cash out to be so low. Re read the betOver 1.5 goals Man City 2nd half, I never added Man City to it, quickly phone Ladbrokes customer service the game was still running, the lady answered and said the bet is still not settled so nothing can be done, I said I’ll speak to a supervisor please, she put me on hold, came back 20 minutes later with, can’t do nothing as the bet has been settled. In this time Man City has scored in the 95th minute whilst I was on the phone so my bet of 1.5 goals total second half would have come in. I was on hold for 45 minutes to speak with a manager, who told me do I have proof of making that selection, of course not I did it on my mobile. I said you have two receipts there settled one with a cash out after placing it, cash out took a fiver loss, then you can clearly see I placed another bet two minutes later same game, same 1.5 goals total. These people are very very cunning, they will do everything in your power too take your money, they’ll even make your bets up for you, all betting sites cards, slots, betting you have too see Ladbrokes have designed it too win, even when the odds are a million to one in your favour, in the blink of an eye, those odds will crumble. Your get dealt 2x 10 in black jack, odds of losing very very very low, and the dealer with pull out 21. I’m not disgruntled or a sore loser as I have won today and currently up by £60/70 so I’m not writing this out of being a sore loser, I have wrote this so all can see what Ladbrokes thinks is okay to do. I wouldn’t even give them one star it’s a sham of a company and severely need to be investigated.",1

2021-10-21,"I play on A LOT of bingo/slots sites. I have never come across a site as boring and costly as ladbrokes. I play online bingo on other sites and when you play a lot you get a feel for where you should be at within a certain number of calls…On ladbrokes, I didn’t even get close and I didn’t win once..,,I spent A LOT! The rooms aren’t ‘rammed’ there’s probably like 30/40 in the room and you can buy maximum tickets but not even get close. Sometimes 10 numbers called in a row without any on your ticket. The slots…I play piggy riches, rainbow riches and Amazon queen. These are my go to games on any other sites as they pay out frequently…Don’t bother on ladbrokes. They won’t pay out, you won’t hit the bonus round and if you spend enough to get a bonus round it will pay you around £3 I thought ladbrokes was a trustworthy and recognised site. I’m absolutely shocked.The bingo winners are NEVER in the chat rooms and their names are usually a mixture of random letters and numbers, some may assume they are computer generated names 🤔Please don’t waste your time in here. I’ve been playing online slots for over 15 years and this site has shocked me. I expected more 🤷🏻‍♀️I didn’t think such a ‘reputable’ brand could be so blatantly fixed. Ladbrokes….do better.",1

2021-10-17,"I joined because they had a offer on. I played multiple games and kept a cycle of losing, depositing money, losing, etc. The problem came when I won. I had £300 in my account which I wanted to withdraw, but then when I tried to withdraw it they decided that they needed proof of my ID, despite not needing that when I was giving them money. I showed them my ID, including walking 30 mins (and back!) to the local branch and showing them my ID (passport and drivers licence), as they requested, only for them to still not allow me to withdraw funds. Now, they claim I only have £50 in my account and can withdraw it, but as soon as I questioned where the other £250 went, they said they need to check my ID before letting me withdraw anything.I wish I had known at the time that this is what Ladbrokes do, but they are famous for it. Coral is owned by the same group, so avoid them too. They are nothing more than a fraud in my eyes. I will have to take them to small claims court to get my £300, it's ridiculous.",1

I work full time and hard for my dollar and what i do with it is my business.

For the slots is exactly the same thing ...everything is rigged...I never won any jackpots which is very suspicious .. i never won some serious money regarding how much i have spend and 100% from the time in the bonus game i get a few pounds win which is ridiculous ... they made the drop rate almost 0% ! Stop playing at ladbrokes people... It s ridiculous and everything is rigged .... 0 stars in 6 years ...all i can say is that Christmas is coming and the Ladbrokes Directors or owners need cash for their Holidays by robbing people .

Yeah yeah whatever.

I only have a small balance as I’m not a big stake person. I have contacted them by email, live messenger chat, and recently by phone, (all very disappointing customer experiences) they asked me to send in a copy of my driving licence which I reluctantly did & then insisted that I set up a new email address or I will not be able to withdraw my credit balance. I have memory problems so I can’t deal with 2 email addresses so I don’t want to do this. They are happy to communicate with me via my current email address, besides I don’t see how a new email address would assist in withdrawal of funds. I’m now left with no alternative but to make a complaint to the gambling commission about their unreasonable behaviour. My advice is not to do business with these people and if you must please make sure you keep your credit balance to an absolute minimum in case they decide to pull the rug under you !",1

2021-10-05,"Earlier today I placed a bet on horse racing at odds of 29, with a £50 stake, the obvious returns would be £1,450. But once I pressed 'place bet', it went to a review screen explaining how this could take up to 2 minutes (I've never seen this before). To my disbelief my £50 bet at 29 odds, had split into 2 seperate bets of £25 each, this wouldn't really be a big issue, but one of the £25 bets had odds of 29, while the other £25 bet had odds of 'SP' - which I've had to educate myself on very briefly since I don't know what it even is. Since the 2 bets have been placed, I've spoken to multiple people at Ladbrokes and they say they have no way of splitting a bet once its been placed. So the winnings were £725 for bet 1 and £275 for the other, subsequently returning £450 less than what I should have gotten. All Ladbrokes say is to further my dispute I have to provide ""evidence of what happened"". I wouldn't think that a review screen would come up once I placed my £50 but it did and I definitely wouldn't think that Ladbrokes would split my bet in 2 and to make matters worst not put on the right odds placed.I am extremely unhappy with Ladbrokes and the customer service that has no intention of actually trying to help me.",1

Which by the way is actually bs it clearly states in my account Hastings as the city, why there systems show me Hastings gilbralar is bizzare and personally I think they did it on purpose. I have raised a complaint and if I don't get the reversed funds back I will take this further to gambling commission or IBAS. They claim I put gilbraltar, yet my street address and town is clearly a UK address, Mt bank matches the UK address which I deposit from, its a UK bank account, they surely did verification with me also so how can they claim I am in gilbralar. My I.P. address is in the UK not on a proxy server and they claim their slots are random generated",1

Started playing then msg came up saying I had insufficient credit. I talked to customer service they said I'd been playing for £1.25 (I have played in many slot sites and I know what I set it at) hardly think over £30 pounds go missing when it was set at 25p. Result I closed my account indefinitely they can keep the money but won't be getting a single penny more from me,1

2021-08-20,"The big problem with Ladbrokes website is how slow it is to respond after clicking its login and other features. Why is it so slow?The other problems are (1) That it logs you out after a period of inactivity. Which occurs whilst studying what you want to bet on throuout the days racing. Being logged out means loss of time getting a bet on. I've missed bets because of this.(2) When choosing Horseracing. It opens up on Meetings, so to get upcoming races you have to click again. To get that. Then you have to click particular race headings to open up all the horses and prices in a race.This all takes time and often bets are not able to be made because of having to click through these options.",3

2021-08-14,"Worst betting app I’ve had the misfortune to use. Don’t play their casinos. You can’t win. Don’t bother with free bet promotions. They are a con in my opinion. I got €20 in a free bet from one of their promotions, as my horse didn’t win and they gave a free bet. I placed the free bet on a horse. €10 each way. It came in. My returns? Nothing, nada, zilch. Unbelievable. Watch the small print. They tell you that you will get money back as a free bet if you horse doesn’t win in a particular race. What they fail to tell you clearly is that if you bet on two horses in that race.  say a short odds and a long shot, they will only pay out on the first horse you bet on. So if you put €1 e/W on a horse, then place a €10 bet to win on another, they will only give a free bet on the €1 bet. It’s all there in the very tiny T&Cs. It’s a rip off. Their customer service on live chat is rubbish. They are slow & rude. You could spend   half an hour waiting for a proper response and then they can’t answer your query. Useless. Don’t use free bets for the casino. When you go into it, they use YOUR money to bet. When you complain, they give the money back but it is “restricted” do you HAVE to spend it on casino games even though you might not play those games. Either way, they have forced you to spend your own money on casinos and needless to say, you don’t win. All in all. The worst app and company ever. Betway is much better. (so far). Hope this review has been useful folks. My advice? Look elsewhere if you want to have fun.",1

2021-08-13,"Ladbrokes, I must say that the amount of reviews you have and the majority not being above two stars is quite astonishing. You are one of the biggest names in the gambling industry and have plenty of adverts flying around, maybe you should listen to your customers and try to improve your rating.Recently opened account and everything is fine, the sportsbook is really good, customer service is really good also. From my reviews I do like my slots also, i kinda knew ladbrokes was not great but had a go, deposited £60 and got up to £160. withdraw my £60 which was really fast, and played with £100. lost that and deposited another £100 and lost that. I have since closed my casino account, but have kept my sportsbook and will use these regularly. I would of like to have given more stars, but I feel for such a big company Ladbrokes could be fairer on there gaming side, the slots i play are the same on all my sites and you can always get a feel for them, I just knew I was never going to win. I hit One bonus game and the rest were just small in play wins and dead spins. Like I said I wont be playing again but plenty people will, you should deffo give people more of a chance.",2

The member of staff took half an hour to inform me that this hidden tax of rule 4 was in play and that in one race it was 10p in the pound tax and in the other race it was 60p in the pound tax. Yet this was not in the results in the morning paper nor mentioned when watching the races. The assistant didnt have a clue what she was doing and eventually motioned me to a page on the internal TV which said rule 4 applied and not much else.

2021-08-04,"I’ve actually had enough of Ladbrokes now and there claims that it is fair gambling etc and by chance! I been playing eye of the Horus for a long time some times I sit up and play for 8-12 hours at a time as if it’s my job, some will say “that’s a problem” but that’s my problem having been doing this for soo long I’m seeing and experience the same pattern over and over again. I could deposit 800 quid and play for 10 hours and if I’m lucky I’ll collect 820 quid, I’ve had the feature 5/6 times in a row and had less then a tenner back each time and that will be after they have taken 500 pound off me. Makes no sense and it’s unfair. It’s doing the same thing over and over again there’s nothing random about it. I could literally spend 1000 depositing 50 100 80 etc and it will not let me hold a balance of no more then what I deposited and that’s once I’ve basically put 1000 quid in. I only ever play on £1 and 2 stakes really so when I decided to do one spin at 20 quid and got the feature the other day bearing in mind it had taken 3 thousand off me I got overly excited jumping off my chair thinking I was gonna get a massive win THE GAME GAVE ME a tenner. I’ve never felt so disappointed in my life and I’m writing this review now with tears in my eyes because it’s actually sad that when I do get a next bit of money I’ll try again. I know I’m not the only person this is happening to aswel yet it’s justified and it’s allowed. And all customer service say is “where sorry your not happy and that it is random”There’s nothing random about what’s happening. Your taking advantage of peoples gambling addictions and getting away with it. I wish I had it in me to just stop just like that but I’ll only end up playing more in casinos this is the final straw for me. I’m a grown man with responsibility’s that has acted irresponsible and this morning you guys have robbed me of everything I have, I’m all for fair gambling and I understand I can’t win every time but don’t m*g me off in my face the way you have been. I don’t for one second believe it’s fair I mean look at the reviews. What’s it going to take for you to fix up, my mind right now isn’t even straight because of that game and low and behold the small amount of money I do have left the only thing now on my mind because of that loss is alcohol, I’m sick of you lot,",1
2021-08-03,"I've been trying to get Ladbrokes to close my account for months after they restricted my ability to get guaranteed odds on horse racing with no explanation. I first complained they don't treat customers as individuals, they replied 'Dear Paul' which isn't my name. I asked for my account to be closed, citing their poor customer service - they didn't do it.  I asked again - they didn't do it.  I asked again, cc-ing the Gambling Commission, Ladbrokes said they'd closed the account, including what I felt was patronising information information about safer gambling in their confirmation email which was wholly unrelated to my complaint, appearing to be a 'tick box' exercise and yet they haven't closed the account judging by the account holder email I got last week.  Their customer care is appallingly incompetent, they don't treat customers as individuals and in my experience they make it extremely hard to close an account which should surely take just one click from a customer and makes me very concerned about how they must treat problem gamblers wanting to be excluded.",1

Like how someone is supposed to want to choose this crowd over say Paddy Power or Boylesports is beyond me but you’ve been warned. I’ve moved to bet365 myself and I’m loving it compared to this crap, we need to start avoiding the greedy bookies there’s so much competition so shop around guys, remember these clowns are nothing without us punters and this shower are so far behind for the reputation they have it’s disgusting that folks spend good money on this crap. Get your crap together Ladbrookes your like something from a bygone era. And don’t worry I’ve literally lost you clowns around 100 customers whom would be regular punters just by educating friends and colleagues on how bad you clowns are it would be like preferring an Alfa Romeo over a BMW to continue playing with you goons. I’m actually embarrassed for you. No doubt your staff are probably underpaid too if I was to check I know a greedy company when I see one.

2021-07-21,"There has been an incident which happened in Ladbrokes betting shop in East Finchley, London on 11th and 12th July 2021. On 11th July 2021, my husband and I went to the aforementioned betting shop, wanting to place a bet for Italy to win the Euro cup. There was only one Italian girl at that time in the shop, barely speaking English, and my husband said very clear that we want to put £50 for Italy to win the game (the cup), because we don’t bet usually and we have absolutely no idea about the rules or anything. She said it is fine, calculated how much we would get, and handed us a piece of paper with saying ‘’ITALY TO WIN’’. As I said, we were very clear we don’t want to put Italy to win in 90 minutes, or Italy to win in penalties etc… just to win in general. We have been told later that this girl doesn't even work in this shop so I have no idea why she worked that day and who is she. As Italy won, we came back the next day to the same shop, and have been told that the ticket is a losing ticket. And the reason was because the girl who was working that day, put ‘’Italy to win in 90 minutes’’. Again, we have never told her to put that. First of all, the people working there were really rude to my husband and they just gave a customer service number to my husband, and sent him off. We called the number and got HUNG UP twice. After that, we went to a different shop which is in North Finchley, London. The manager there told us this was unacceptable and that they should give us back the money. He said that at the first place, the girl who worked there, should have given us the paper with all the bets as we didn't know anything about betting, and that she acted extremely unprofessional. And that is very obvious we usually don't bet. He even called the manager of the shop we placed the bet. Few days after that, my husband spoke to the manager of East Finchley branch, and has been told that the girl who worked that day, denied us saying that we don’t know anything about bidding and that we didn’t say we want Italy to win the cup. That is absolutely not true but she is obviously covering herself. We were denied any refund.I want to be very clear, this is NOT about the money, it is about the PRINCIPLES. We never bet and we are not in this betting world, but there has been absolutely no respect whatsoever from the people working in the shop and people working in your customer service.Somebody else placed a bit for us and placed the wrong bid, and it is just not fair. Before I conclude this complaint, I just want to mention that I am not willing to stop until I have this sorted.",1

2021-06-21,I haven't logged into my Ladbrokes account since March. I logged in today. My account has nothing in it (there was  only £18.75 in March). I cannot find any way of contacting Ladbrokes. Any ideas how I can chat or phone them?,1
2021-06-20,"On Friday, the 18th of June 2021 I brought a pay safe voucher of £40 from my local shop I haven’t used Ladbrokes for quite some time and joined them about a year and a half ago in which I had to pass verification to do that are use my driving license and bankcard at the time since then I’ve rarely use Ladbrokes as found that I would win more playing on bet betfair online casino. On Friday after using the pace I felt you were £40 and only that £40 I came into a bonus on volt cracker and it gave me times 10 from 650 odd pound making it 6 1/2 thousand pound winnings I immediately cashed it couldn’t believe my luck asked for a bank transfer because I hadn’t use my card to put the money on so I thought bank transfer it and within about 10 to 15 minutes I received a reply that my account was shut down suspended. I know I wanted to do a second verification to make sure it was my bank account that was being paid into now last year I was hit by fraudulent activity on a couple of my bank accounts in which I’ve had a couple of cards for each one Ladbrokes now want me to take pictures of every single one of my old cards that I’ve used and send them to them can anybody explain to me how are you meant to get it through to these people on an online chat service where you can’t express yourself and you can’t get enough time before you’ve got a computer typing back at you all my old accounts as I’m sure anybody else would do you cut the cards up And destroy any paperwork to do with those accounts as you would not be using them ever again why would you keep something that will never use. Ladbrokes seem to think that everybody should have a box in the loft because they don’t listen I’ve now had to send off pictures of everything and email after email for the past two days I meant to be spending today with my daughter for Father’s Day she’s 4 months old but I can’t because I’m having to chase this money. I’ve had a couple of agents on the online messenger say just hold the line we are going to call security because my house was burgled three months ago and my only photographic identity was my driving license which I used at the start when I first opened the account to verify myself luckily I had a photo of my driving license on my phone backed up on iCloud it’s exactly the same driving license the same picture of the same address and of course the same name my name but Ladbrokes say they can’t accept that because it’s a picture which seems very strange because I just wanna picture of that anyway but now they wanna picture of me holding it as I did in the first verification because this to anybody else seem pointless does it seem like Ladbrokes have taken fathers day away from my daughter because to me at first I was angry but no more upset that people so high up feel they can pressure and bully until people give up on what is rightfully theirs well I’m not going to do that I’m going to carry this on every single day to 3 times a day until my winnings are paid into my account and released from Ladbrokes because I’ve done nothing wrong all I am is a normal average day today man with a young family that had some luck. I will write on this forum every single day two times a day until Ladbrokes realise that they have made a big mess of things because twice the online agents have asked security what else can I provide because of my house being burgled the driving license being taken of a legal documentation basically fraud identity in the end I only have one bank account now I sent through two statements which are headed with of course my name my account number my sort code and of course my address is the same as what was on the license a year and a half ago when I first registered and the same as what is on the picture of the license that same license from a year and a half ago unfortunately it’s just in picture formatIt’s still the same name same dress and if you look at the photo really closely it sort of looks like me it’s me so ask me now Ladbrokes before I have to expose this more after the lies and deceit of the last two days I’ve had to put up with apart from two of your CallCenter agents unless I did not speak to security to pay what’s rightfully mine it’s no wagering requirements it was purely money that I put on from a pay safe voucher purchased in my local Cornershop on CCTV shows me purchasing it if we go through PayPoint you can get the times we get the times in the day and we went back to the CCTV and you’ll see me purchasing the £40 price I felcher I don’t think that I really need to keep going on anymore I think that I’ve exposed you enough today to say what’s rightfully mine should be coming back to me I hope that you can be diplomatic about this and I hope that you find it in yourself to do the right thing as I am just a normal man leading a normal life who had a wonderful 15 minutes of joy on Friday when I had that big win. I suffer with PTSD and manic depression 😭😭",1

2021-06-17,have not used my account for some time but had numerous open bets for which country would leave the eu next. i've lost several hundreds of pounds because they deleted them and when i looked into my betting history it had all been deleted. they sent me a printout for which they said was all my history since 2016. the report only went as far back to 2019 and i actually won over £570 on brexit in 2016 from them. don't trust them!!,1
2021-06-17,"I feel like i got ripped off majorly by this website. I've been playing 2 specific slots (Rise of Olympus and Moon princess) for quite a while now and i noticed that the return (RTP) is less than 30-40% (and that is me being nice, i have actually lost majority of the money that i deposited just to play those slots). At first i thought it was in my head and maybe i am just unlucky but i realized that there were rarely any bonuses, 90% of the time they would pay around 15-30x my bet tops and there would be one case that it would pay 200-400x but it wouldn't even cover what i lost before that. I case across the reviews on trustpilot and i can see that a lot of people are facing the same issue. Is this actually a scam? I thought ladbrokes was popular and decent but i am having doubts. I never had such a loss streak or no bonus streak in other websites so i am not sure how legit this is?!?!",1
2021-06-16,"Hats off to everyone at Ladbrokes. Top, quick service, whenever I needed it. The promotions are what sets this company apart. Loads of freebies, which are really handy when money is tight and you want to spice up the sports experience. In Euros alone I've been given a freebet each day. Amazing! With such treatment, I'd much rather deposit my money with them than with their competitors. Keep it up guys!",5

2021-06-12,"I seen the add - join and play now. Lie number that was, I joined and had no problem. It said verifying account, received email straight away saying my account had been verified. Then said deposit 10 pound to play. I deposited 10 pound. Went to do 20p spin and wouldn't let me. Spent 4 hours talking to none humans, maybe rusty robots as they did not answer my questions properly but replied with scripted messages of the same message. To then be told my account has been verified but there are security issues on my account and I it will take up to 24 hours for a response via email. If this is the case then they should have waited until security issues were sorted before taking money. I do not feel safe on this site as it is rather dishonestI would not recommend this site to anyone it is nothing but hassle, any site that takes your money and gives you excuses as to why you can't spend it there and then is untrustworthy in my eyes. In reality my money is in their account as I am unable to even login to my account due to these so called security issues. If I had of known that I would not have been able to play instantly I would have joined another site, but now that I have joined Ladbrokes and they have pulled this trick I will not be joining another site as Ladbrokes has put me off trying anymore sites.Jackpot joy allows you to join and play immediately, I have won many of times on jackpot joys slots and the best thing is you can withdraw funds and they go straight into your bank account. I can't comment if Ladbrokes do this as they took my money and then wouldn't let me back into my account never mind play.If you are looking for a legit site that is safe to play, I would highly recommend jackpot joy, I would NOT recommend Ladbrokes at all, Ladbrokes even wanted front and back copy of my bank card, this was hours after depositing and them taking my money. I now have to wait until an actual person emails me backIf you like waiting around for replies from robots, have plenty spare time, and money to give away, then join ladbrokes they are happy to take your money, waste your time, verify your account and still not allow you to play. Waste of time. Waste of money. Waste of breathe.",1

2021-06-10,About 20 to 30 games shown on the now live section and only 1 out of them all had a time on it. I mean come on. How are you supposed to make a bet when you don't know what time has gone. I'm a member and have lost all respect. I have screen shots to prove this,1
2021-06-09,Worst company in the UK. I've had 2 or 3 times now where I've had 12 out of 15 games come through and wanted to cash out because the games were the next day and they've not allowed me to. Con artists just stealing your money and the minute you get anywhere near a pay out they say that their website was glitched or they couldn't calculate the odds on a game that ended hours ago. AVOID!,1

Why take the deposit and the bet and then decide it’s not my card.  Totally scam. I’ve emailed them explaining it was a genuine oversight. Will be taking this further out of principal. Let’s see what they say.Update - they have added my card so hopefully it will work now. I’ll update accordingly,1

2021-05-27,Hi I'm after some advice please as Ladbrokes have the worst customer care I have ever had to deal with in my life!!!I won £3600 on the slots and still had X5 win spin remaining and they sent me an error and then the game shows unfished and never paid out! I have contacted Ladbrokes 6 days ago who say it's a third party game and they have to wait for the game to reply to them! They say they have sent them 2 MSG's now! I was wondering if anyone new how long the game company had by law to reply as Ladbrokes can't tell me and now won't reply to my emails!They have also closed my account because I have mental health I have combatt stress disorder and they say they have done this for my health lol! Joke I no! Only stress with mental health I am having is having no money and no answers for a week now from a very poor customer care team! I have bin told to seek legal action on the closing my account and how it has made me feel about having combat stress! Because I fought for my country I'm not allowed to bet! Also on how long this has and still is going on for with no answer or deadline on when this will be sorted even though I have photos for my case that I have sent!Just after advice please as this is really affecting my health and my family life!ThanksBen,1

2021-05-24,Made multiple bets and deposits and withdrawals with no problems until I tried to withdraw £1000 then they froze my account for verification. Now every time I send the required documents they are rejected with no reson as to why or witch documents are not satisfactory. Apart from there automated message asking for all the documents to be sent again. I honestly fell powerless in this situation as there is no line of contact for any one who can deal with it directly. Now when j send emails to there team they are rejected by there server and sent back. Guess I'll just be sending lots of emails in different formats and ways until it is finally accepted although I fell like it never will be at this point Kind regards Dean mccallum,1
2021-05-23,"Made an account for the welcome offer, deposited 10 pounds and won a few pounds with that, proceeded to use my welcome offer and wins kept on coming in. I spent a long time - hours and hours building up my balance and trying to work off the wagering requirements. I ended up with a substantial balance after a couple nights and had a big portion of my wagering requirements away when my account got blocked the first time..  I wrote to ladbrokes facebook page to sort it and at first they seemed keen to help to get it resolved. my account was active again and I logged in, I built a little bit of my balance up  further, got a little bit more of my wagering requirements down, and yet again funnily enough as my balance increased and my wagering requirements decreased my account is blocked again. This time I wrote again to the facebook page who then advised me that my account was closed due to ""business decisions"" LOL aye business decisions like you didnt wanna have to pay out on your promo offer cause you are too used to making money off of new joinees. Too used to people losing. As soon as someone makes profit and they havent put enough money in your filthy pockets you block their account and make up some BS with very little explanation why. It doesnt take much more then someone with half a brain to figure out that you are conning customers out of their accounts and deposits. if they make substantial wins without you making money off them right away you block their account to avoid paying out. Facts. I was then advised to write to the customer support email rather then the facebook page to get my 10 pounds back. not even my winnings I made before even using the promo offer, which was like 6 pounds or something, albeit small still absolutely shameful not to give me my legit winnings. Furthermore, when I wrote to the customer support email, I was told my 10 pounds would be with me soon, and I'd recieve an email in a couple working days. Get this.... 2 months passed and I realised that I STILL hadn't recieved my tenner back or this magical mystical email from ladbrokes. So I yet AGAIN wrote this time having to threaten with trading standards to get my money back. I mentioned the fact it had been 2 months and this email hadn't appeared. I had to basically threaten with trading standards to get my 10 pounds back, MY money I had to threaten to get back. Ladbrokes didnt even have the f***ing decency to write back to me, apologize or f*** all. But funnily enough the 10 pounds ""cash advance"" as it was called on my bank statement came through. I knew I wasnt gonna hear anything back from them. Honestly just a s**tshow of a company. S*** customer service, try to get away with stealing your money if they can. Block you from getting your winnings. Embarrassing trampy behaviour. Take your money elsewhere. Honestly dont even bother sending your fake BS apologies to this review, it's all just to make it look like you care. Its obvious that you do not.",1

In response to your reply I’ve been told it will be sorted soon since 08:00 yesterday morning and whoever I contact they don’t give me anymore help they just say the same as you it will be sorted soon, it’s basically theft at this point. I actually clicked on a bet and it said deposit and place bet.. that bet won and shock your saying it wasn’t placed. Your awful. Also you say a fault with your deposits yet your still allowing me to try and deposit (not that I would) so you are potentially letting other people have the same problems when you know an issue is there...also you have now just offered to credit my account £20 to apologise, this proves what I’ve been saying for the last 24 hours you could of just credited my account and then sorted the issue whilst I still had my own money",1

2021-05-16,Since I’ve joined over the last 2 - 3 months I have not won a day I have bet. I have wagered and lost between £3000 and £5000 during this time. I must express this has not been the case with many other sites I use. They would have stepped in with many warnings and emails and notificicariins of advice to use gambling controls before eventually taking matters into their own hands and temporarily suspending my account.In one sitting I will wager £500 for example lose it all straight away then £300 then £200 till there’s nothing left. With other sites you will usually go up and then down then up then down over the period of time. Not lose every single bet.I have bet every few days some days a week for a few months and unlike many many other sites would see this amount lost as a red flag and would have automatically suspended my account pending authorisation of ID or even just inbox me suggesting to take controls of the gambling using their sites. Ladbrokes have not done this. I have screenshots of all of this including the times when I’ve played and the winning number in roulette has been chosen without the ball even spinning and also producing a result just before the ball stops.I’m really dissatisfied I’ve not been protected as a customer from being advised to take further steps in regards to safer gambling controls  and have decided to take it further. I will not be wasting my time even asking for the money back from a customer advisor for the company as I know they will not assist me with it. I should have been stopped long before now from losing all this money.I have never had an email of concern and I have searched “Ladbrokes” in my inbox every single day of the week offering me promotions to continue gambling and on my account the same thing more offers. I even had inbox message today with more offers and special bonuses after wagering and losing £1500 last night. just don’t bother signing up! at least other company’s have recognised unusual behaviour and stepped in.,1

I’ll be seeing more about this!!!Ladbroke terms states-RetirementOnce a player has started playing in a tournament, bets will stand on them for outright tournament betting purposes.

2021-05-11,"Dont use Ladbrokes. Their promotions are utter garbage, they want you to deposit things such as 10 euros and bet on the moneyline, and in return you get  a few free spins that no matter how many chances you get, you will never crack the code. Ive had literally like 30 to 40 spins and could only get all but two of the correct digits. Their only good promos are for new customers. What do the loyal customers who have been with them for years get? No incentive to keep on depositing on this website. Honestly bwin has a lot more to offer, only reason i stayed with ladbrokes more than bwin was because the withdrawal is extremely fast, but even with that, its not worth the headache of corrupt leadership and customer service who never help you unless it is because they need something from you.

I feel ladbrokes have took advantage of a problem gambler and since this incident my mental state as declined.On the 10.04.21 I reached out for support with gamstop who gave me advice and helped me to put a self exclusion ban in place with all online casinos I had registered with.I felt this was in my best interests along with my families as I felt that while my accounts were open I had no control over the frequency or amount I was depositing .It  was getting to the point I wasn't Caring if I was winning or losing as long as I was able to play slot games. After about a week of gamstop being in place I began to go on to check that my accounts had been blocked and started to delete the apps from my phone.It was then I realised that ladbrokes had failed to close my account down and problems began again. I knew if i deposited and even if I won anything that I would not have been able to withdraw because of my ban.Over a 12 day period ladbrokes allowed me to deposit over £2000 knowing that any winnings would not be allowed be withdrawn but happily aloud for the deposits to be made.I got in contact with a member of staff from the ladbrokes live chat team on the 26.04.21 who confirmed that gamstop was definitely in place.I then contacted gamstop on the 26.04.21 who advised me to email ladbrokes and send them a copy of my registration. I can also confirm gamstop also passed over this information to ladbrokes.It was only after this email that ladbrokes saw their error and my account was then closed.I feel extremely cheated by ladbrokes, I have been a valid customer for years and they failed to safeguard and comply with their self exclusion policy.",1

2021-04-11,"Do not bother with this rubbish, the bingo and repeat winners is statistically impossible, free weekly game 3000 plus players and yet same winners week after week and they very rarely miss a bingo session. As for the slots they are an absolute disgrace and another site that teamed up with competitors and lowered there rtp on grand national day as they knew footfall would increase.A small update for things to watch out for when playing here......The truthSo, I'm going to go through some the the tricks to look out for as prove there scamming, some of you may have notice before but not really taken enough notice.1. The good old log you out trick, often logs you out during longer game plays on slots this is usually when the operator is shift changing. Your notice on returning back into the site your be on a dead spin cycle as your account was added to the new shift log.2. Stun freezing or pinch lag , this is not your connection it's them changing your outcome eg. RTP after you see this your go on a dead spin cycle usually too 0 balance but right before it hits 0 your receive a small consolation prize like 6x.3. Jumping from slot to slot and window hanging at 99%, this is because you changed provider and there tracking you to add you back into the shift log, it usually requires a refresh of the page or even a relogin.4 switching from slots to live games signalling, what this is if site deem your balance as cash dump account your name will display in red in the live studio to the live games host look out for them glancing left as you first login the screen is top left of the host. This will effect your betting try it of you disbelieve me place all number on roulette leave 1 number open I'll bet it hit the number you don't cover.5, forcing redeposit , now this one is free will but if your a gambler your get what I mean. On your last few spins after the slots has drained your whole balance your notice a longer duration spin this will either be a tease for that bonus you been chasing or a manipulated win of 5x just to get you to redeposit from another round !6. Set balance , this one is the scam they use most frequently for example your deposit £100 during how ever long they decide your balance will stay between that number it will never go over or lose too 0 this is there fair play system but you will never profit! Your know when this is happening because high tier bonus features especially on blue prints will pay 0- 10x. I personally have had the max bonus and got 3x completely manipulated wins. None of the RTPs are genuine on the slots they control them all day long !7. Gambling control emails, you probably have had this sent on various occasions but did you know all this is a temp trick to get you to login and deposit. I've spoken to my friend that works for a site and they say they send them when business is slow but it's legal apparently.8, dead spin speed up, you can check this one easy enough auto play speed up scam. Now if your from the UK your spin must be at 2.5 seconds anything less is considered a breach of the GC rulings. Go to king Kong blue print on mobile and click auto play you will notice that after a few spins it will rapidly speed up on dead spins to drain your balance faster !NOW TELL ME YOU HAVENT NOTICE ANY OF THESE",1

2021-04-02,I won £27 off a £1 live roulette bonus off their TV advetised Instant Win Spins. I've emailed them about 50 times though because they have tied my winnings to a bonus they gave me around a week or more previously with a turnover of £2000 for a £50 casino bonus to which i was left with 10p. So basically they keep replying and ignoring my pleas that these winnings were NOTHING at all to do with that. They are basically saying now that i can't play anything in the casino as it's all going to contribute to that £2000 play through so can't even win money off my own real cash. I had trouble with these chat staff clowns last year when i won £28 off another bonus and couldn't withdraw because of card issues. They once again kept ignoring the messages and the problems i was getting back. In the end i just spent the money on other bets as couldn't be bothered pursueing the money via ibas etc. And then sure enough when i tried to deposit money at a later date it worked fine. I'm very experiences on betting sites and would advise not to bother wasting your time as the sites very slow on an average phone and the chat staff are completely ignorant and won't even raise to management like I've asked on countless occassions.,1

I personally expect toLose sometime but not 100% of the time.I have played this for hours as well and find it very frustrating that they kick you out after 60mins as if to say you have had enough we are being responsible but you wont win your money back.Please don’t fall into my trap and try to win some money back as you won’t!! Stay well clear if you want a fair chance to win anything",1

2021-03-08,Ladbrokes should be ashamed been playing slots for many years I set myself a weekly budget and always stay within my limit. When I first started playing slots on Ladbrokes I would deposit about £25 and I could play roughly for about 1hr doing 20p spins I would very rare walk away up because I do enjoy playing the slots but the last few weeks I’ve been depositing the same amount and I’m lucky if it last more than 10min very rare do I get a feature but if I do it is very low win for instance I was playing fishing frenzy I had 5 scatters and it paid £10.70 that was the final straw. I’ve never believed that slot machines are fixed but I’m starting to believe that Ladbrokes have definitely done something to the way they play. I’m starting to think because of covid that and they have had to close the shops that they have to generate money from somewhere. PLEASE if you are thinking of signing up to Ladbrokes to play slots be prepared to lose and lose very quick,1

Everything is set up through to the website media, the live games with hosts to engage you to such an extent. Please avoid Ladbrokes, they do not care about customers. With these dark times we have been living in with Covid, it is very easy for people to get addicted to playing on websites like Ladbrokes. They have ruined peoples lives, it's about time the government stop them running games online 24/7 and where you can put large amounts of money into one game. It's very easy to loose a lot and they do not do enough to stop that, only to entice people more. They do the bare minimum on safer gambling in my opinion.

They use bots and i advise to stay far away from these scamming scum",1

Its not just ladbrokes poker alone its right across the board. online poker is not poker its a video game. Same old faces get lucky in every tourny.

I did contact them they said that’s perfectly normal so I closed my account. Still having emails off them one email said that they noticed something went wrong with a game a was playing so they have put 14p into my account I would like to point out I was playing £2 a spin on the big banker.. I’m lucky in life to be able to afford to have a little gamble... you will not win more then your deposit.. for example if you put £20 on your account you might have the odd 5p win you will find then you will be on your last few spins and you will win say £15 but then watch how quickly the wheels spin without a win. It’s crazy if you have little income stay away from all sites I would also like to point out carol is part off Ladbrokes and their site as gone the same.. over the time my account as been active I’ve put in £40,000 and just had out 31,000 so if that don’t tell you something nothing will.

2021-02-03,"Any one who plays on a few casino sites knows how difficult it is to beat wagering on any welcome offers. I was on my way to doing just this on Labrokes, £50 welcome bonus 40x wagering at 2k. The bonus was set to expire at 11:59pm on the 27th, I was quite happily playing through on the evening of the 27th when I went to check on the wagering progress & guess what the expiry now stated the 28th! I was dubious anyway & decided to meet the wagering that evening & whilst playing through (nearing a tidy £175 profit) the bonus just disappeared mid-spin! This was at 10:59pm. I of course complained & received a generic reply stating I hadn't wagering requirements in time, I provided screen shots of the stated expiry time & the time the bonus funds disappeared & even had a responce from customer services stating I had ""quite rightly pointed out that the bonus was removed at 23:00 an hour before the expiry time shown in your screenshot""Basically you'll probably never beat a 40x wager requirement & even if it's looking like you might Ladbrokes will just take the money away anyway!!!",1

Ladbrokes have no control over the slots they supply, just because you got a Megaways feature, this isn’t a guarantee you’re going to win +200x - this is programmed into the game, which again, they have no control over.Anyway, moving onto legitimate issues - Ladbrokes is a massive name here in the U.K, but what I can’t fathom, is that in 2021, they’re banking processes is massively lacking those other big names that can have your withdrawal in your bank within 10 minutes?  I have waited 96 hours from pressing that withdrawal button to the funds appearing in my account - surely to keep up with your competitors, you would want one of the most important factors to players to be the most efficient(?).  Furthermore, their recent app update from a few months ago, has added nothing in terms of fluid navigation between menus and pages, it all still seems very slow and...clunky.  Anyway, Ladbrokes continue to supply a great selection of slots, but I will be playing elsewhere until they revisit their banking issues.",2

2020-12-07,I spoke to Wendy just a few minutes ago. She started by asking my name and date of birth - fair play for legal compliance purposes. She next tried to find an account after I'd stated my enquiry and told me I had a closed account. I told her this account would be ancient. She next told me that I should go to the frequently asked questions section. I'd asked her how I placed a bet on Eastenders. She really couldn't be bothered. Won't bother with Ladbrokes again. A customer is most likely to contact customer services when they couldn't find what they were looking for.I suggested they'd get an appalling rating if I was a mystery shopper. She disconnected the chat.,1
2020-12-04,If i could give a minus star I would.  This site is great until you try to withdraw winnings.  They are quick to take money from your bank account without   photographic proof of what you look like but insist on it when you wish to withdraw money back into the same account.

If you can't afford to lose it, don't gamble it. Funny how people that give a negative review also have multiple reviews for other gaming sites and all have the same theme......don't play here I lost x amount of money therefore the site is a scam.

It will be settled 24-48 hours after that.If you try to use the live chat, be aware that they use pre determined scripts and are of no use whatsoever.On the plus side, the accounts department is very good and money is transferred to your bank very quickly.",2

I won on the spins, it did not pay out, I was told they would be credited manually and were not. Queried yet again on live chat to be disconnected.Promotions are in your options, in your account.

He then told me the revelant team is asking for a mugshot (this was after I fought and said I have been verified to which he eventually contacted this relevant team, who said to send a ""mugshot to continue verifying my account).When you read this, don't think...

2020-11-08,About 5 days ago on Monday I set up an account with coral on there app.That evening I deposited roughly 60 euro. At first I lost 40 and on my final 20 euro I then hit a perfect pair twice on blackjack and won a total of 675 euro here's were the ordeal begins. I decided to quit while I was ahead and begun the process of withdrawing my money I then was asked for documents to verify my account. I sent off everything and continued using my account. I also withdrew the 675 to PayPal which it siad was pendingI knew It wouldn't go trough until my account was fully verified.The following morning I tried logging into my coral account and a banner appeared stating your account has been closed please contact customer services to which i siad omg what will happen to my money. There phone service was down so I rang GVC in gibrater they couldn't help me either. There live chat is joke they just say the team is reviewing it. During a conversation I siad to the live chat person that I badly needed the money.Which is a lie I just wanted them to give me an answer quick. 2 days later I receive a weird email stating that the team had reviewed my account and siad that during a conversation with one of or live chat workers you made a concerning comment that led them to believe we need to exclude you from your account. To which in replied no because you blocked me from my account for no reason. I taught if I had continued to DEPOSIT money and lose my money they would have siad nothing but because I won your trying to keep my money and not pay out. So now its been a week and I still can't access my account I still haven't received any money into my PayPal I'm so pissed offHas anyone had a similar experience and could anyone recommend anything.

2020-11-05,So after years of depositing with this shower they have taken it upon themselves to conduct a credit check and decided I can have a £100 monthly loss limit only and the games are then locked. This apparently is for my benefit. The tens of thousands of pounds they've already had coupled with criminally low payouts is not even a consideration for them. Ladbrokes and Coral have bled players dry and lockdown has massively boosted their profits which is why they are now back peddling to do something to demonstrate to the regulators they have a moral compass and are limiting players with not such a good credit status. My argument is they have already had tens of thousands of pounds already and are guilty of rigging their games to get it. Suffice to say my account with these rip off merchants and Coral are now closed. Please please please DO Not give these companies a single penny of your money. They will bleed you dry and make out its your fault.,1

My partner and I read a promotion banner on the Ladbrokes website saying bet $25 on the first race of the Flemington horse races and if the horse we backed didn't win we will get our money back. I don't really bet, only with $1-$5 max but I thought with this promotion I will be safe anyways and test my luck. My partner got his money back but I didn't. I gave them a call and they just kept repeating themselves saying the promotion wasn't for everyone. It was only for accounts who received a text (again neither of us got a text, we saw the promotion on the front page of their website on the banners). We didn't receive a text at all, yet my partner got his money back. We were asked to show evidence (screenshot) of the banner we saw. I was like, are you guys for real at this stage...they expect people to take screenshot of all their promotion just in case it turn out to be a lie! So people when you see an ad make sure you take screenshot before you bet! Because how much fun to play like that isn't it?! Just to assume at all times that the promotion that you are playing might not be true and you will be asked for evidence at the end. I was offered $25 worth of bonus bets over the phone by customer service, a guy called Grant who after I asked for his name and said I am going to leave a review about this took his offer back and said actually I am not going to offer you the $25 bonus bet anymore.

2020-10-14,"On Monday 12/10/2020 I placed a £980.00 bet at Ladbrokes Irongate branch Derby. Their cashier Tara committed actual fraud and theft by deliberately giving me different prices on two joint favourites in the 1.50 race at Yarmouth this was blatant fraud and theft. What is worse she refused to give me the serial number of the betting slip when I told her I was going to complain to her customer services dpt, they were even more corrupt their complaints handler Moses told me he would get back to me on Tuesday guess what he never did do not bet with these crooks they are bent and lie constantly. My advice is bet online with a company that give you guaranteed odds. Stay out of Ladbrokes shops they will con you I assure you. P A Enright",1

And tell me I can't have access to the funds I've just deposited either to play or withdraw back to my account for atleast 72 hours. If your going to lock an account well you do checks you should either do before deposit is made or atleast allow people to take there money back it is an absolute joke. And apparently this is the gambling commission rules that tell them to do that or atleast thats what I've just been told via there Web chat screen shot all conversation putting it up on Facebook twitter everywhere for people to see and not trust this company your a absolute shambles of a gambling company william Hill  paddy Power coral accounts with all these never once had an issue like this,1

Then miraculously my bet returned to open bets and I decided I wanted to remove a team mid game but every time i tried the app froze and I had to log in again yet out of interest I deposited money to see if every thing glitches and surprise surprise not an issue! I also encountered no issues with placing further bets so it appears that they’re thieves!  They will happily provide means to take ones money but glitch and prevent one from trying to salvage a bet, they hardly promote responsible gambling and in my opinion are scumbag vultures",1

2020-09-19,"Have used this provider for years for football and racing betting but have recently been foolish and used the gaming sites. TOTAL FIX don’t waste your money, every game is rigged and you will never win. At least with the sports betting it is your choices that ultimately win or lose but with the gaming sites you may as well pour your money down the drain. Shame on you Ladbrokes, for such a big company you don’t need to cheat. Played deal or no deal tonight 0.20p a go and wagered £100 and it did not come up once. That can,t be right, unless it’s fixed. Won’t spend another penny with these a***holes. The government should not allow these thieves to get away with cheating its no better than daylight robbery.",1
2020-09-16,Despite all the below reviews I would like to thank Ladbrokes I received my casino bonus and meet the wagering requirements and won £550 after wager. I cashed out at approx 10pm that night ...24 hours later I received an email confirming my payment had been processed woke up following morning money was in bank. People need to remember it’s a game of luck but slots are not fixed as many comments state below I had winning from deal or no deal Zeus lightening bolts ted and rainbow riches don’t let others comments but you off guys 😊,5

Avoid this betting site! CUSTOMER SERVICE is odds on to be awful everytime!,1
2020-09-15,Ad is very misleading as doesn't say Paypal payments don't qualify for the £50 bonus. It only says PayPalEnvoy which most people will not know is seemingly the same. Also Lynette on chat was quick to cut short the chat when I mentioned this. Don't use Ladbrokes for your casino. Safer using someone like Coral.,1

I spend £1000 and the biggest payout they kept giving me was £30. I pray the world wakes up and doesn't play on these rogue sites anymore then they will go bust and we can sit here laughing at them instead of them laughing their heads off at the mugs we are for wasting our hard earned money on this corrupt company.

On the day of the match, Ladbrokes still had it as a home game, which technically it was. I put my bet on my team to win, which they did. When I looked at my winnings, Ladbrokes had voided it because they said my team were playing away. I hold them to blame because if they were treating my team as the away team, they should have updated their website before accepting the bet so it was quite clear what I was betting on. This is not the first time I have had problems with this company.",1

Regularly I get the message when I want to check open bets''oops we are having trouble loading this page please check your connection'' Nothing wrong with my bloody connection, because I can check settled bets and place bets, but can't check open bets !

I do like a bet although win more than I lose.I don’t really ever go on line though as tend to bet only when at an event Although recently due to not going because of pandemic it seemed like a good idea, when I saw advertised a free bet during a big horse racing festival to have a go, so did. Logged on placed my bet didn’t win. The site encouraged me to have a go on the spinning machines, again first couple of times didn’t win. Then third time I did, the prize was another FREE competition. I clicked on claimed my free go and before I knew it, I appeared to be playing. I thought it was odd as you didn’t have my bank details. Wasn’t worried until I got my mobile bill and have noticed incurred extra charges, this isn’t fair or morally right. I have requested a refund via Facebook and been sent a very rude message back refusing the request. I feel like I’m being petty as the amount is minimal....but it’s the fact I was lead to believe it was free And also how much are they making if this is happening to everyone?",1

2020-07-02,Placed a bet on a draw based on the inplay score Which was showing as 2-2 only to find out Ladbrokes had made a mistake. So the game finished 2-2 in inplay but 2-1 in real life. Wouldn’t refund my stake and said in play isn’t always accurate haha. Customer service was awful spoke to 3 different people and all asked the same things. Bet with a proper company I would advise.,1

2020-07-01,"Just another classic example of how profit and greed mean more than honour, integritiy and respect for players and themselves. The game play on this site is non existent, if you win its low to med low, free spins are a joke. they have games that could pay out multiple 100s even 1000s in free spins. yet if they go over 100 its like the game says right thats your lot attention all other games this person has won their allotted tribute all games now proceed to take it back plus what ever remains of there original deposit. and thats pretty much ever deposit since i remember. I actually though i might have got lucky with some game play the other day i managed to get my winning up to above 400. then RNG switched off and spin after spin game after game spin after spin of nothing. i mean what is the percetages of these games and do they all share the same rigged RBG generator becuase it boggles my mind how all these great games play exactly the same. and talking of rigged or more to the point a game that was great got taken down then came back totaly hacked to crap, Krakon, that poor game it used to play lovely great game then got taken down a good while back now along with amazon queen and Zues and now all three of the games are a total bag of poop. and you can see exactly whats been done to those games if you played them as much i used to its criminally obvious.Ive read all the post i could stand and the general thought towards ladbrokes is not good, but it does seem like they dont give 2 poops what anyone thinks.",1

Game Care they are really strictly on their side as company Ladbrokes. Game Care got money from Casino providers. This is the reason why they does not let gamblers published their experience and they are hide your comment when you are mention companies which are robbed you. Ladbrokes never care about my gambling problems. No one care in the shops and also online. They are keep open and reopen my account same as Coral. I lost there during 12 years around 200 000 pounds on the gambling in the UK. Ladbrokes and Coral got my 50 000 pounds from those money.They are responsible for lots of depression and anxiety. Gamblers are the same like homeless no one cares. Anyone who are playing and put their hard working money on their sites is responsible to create more companies like that which are made billions.

2020-02-15,"My account was closed for ""business reasons"" because I called them out for showing the wrong league tables, which will obviously influence people's betting. Instead of communicating they closed my account with no warning and refused to give a reason aside from the said reason above. I have requested it be reopened as I would still like to bet but they refuse to even entertain the idea and say it is with a different department. Of course if one pulls down the curtains when an accusation is leveled at them then you'd assume that it's basically an admission of guilt.",1

They let you win an equal amount of hands so they can claim their software is fair but they don’t mention that you mainly win when you bet small and lose when you bet big. They keep the W/L balance but in reality the software is rigged to adjust to different size bets. And the gaming commission says it’s fine? Bunch of criminals too,1

SOMETHING VERY FISHY GOING ON. AVOID LADBROKES AT ALL COSTS.",1
2020-01-12,"One star is way too much!These scamming mugs denied me a cash out worth around £500.I had a 6 team Acca Insurance bet, with a £5 stake and a pay out of £1980. 1 team was postponed so I was down to 5 but with the Acca the winnings stayed the same. After 75 minutes all teams were 0-0. With 2 minutes to go I had 4 teams winning and one which seemed to be deadlocked at 0-0. So I thought I'd cash out on the game finishing soonest at 89 minutes, the rest had 4 minutes or so left until injury time.As soon I went to do so, the page reloaded and suddenly this is all I saw on ALL of my winning games.SUSPSUSPSUSPSUSPNo matter how many times I reloaded the page, signed out and signed back in they kept these games suspended. The 0-0 game was not touched as it was already looking to be a goal-less draw which ended up 1-1 in the end. With these suspended screens in place, I was denied cashing out. All final whistles went and the bet was dead! So I talk to one of their C/S people on chat, and according to her it was MY fault for choosing a facility which gave me the option of cashing out. No, really she actually said that! She said I should not have relied on a cash-out feature because it is not guaranteed. So I said to her, in case you're new to this game dear, people use that as a safety buffer in case the bet they want to win has a fluff game and they want to cash-out early to prevent losing the whole bet. That's the whole reason you have the Acca for, is it not? She then just kept on pasting the terms and conditions telling me to read it.So I asked her, if it is not guranteed, you're basically saying that Ladbrokes is taking control away from a paying customer to control their own bet, when that is EXACTY what you offer in the facility for him/her to do in the first place? Again she says, 'read the terms and conditions'.She also said, that according to their terms and conditions, because their 'systems' are in control of the website/app, it can cause games to suddenly become 'unavailable' for cash-out, and according to the 'markets' the system can suspend cashing out. So I said, so what your 'systems' did then, was implement a system setup to find any bet with a potentially high pay-out, block it to prevent the punter using the cash-out facilty, and using loopholes you imply invisible influences cause the paying customer to be denied as though some invisible Ladbrokes pixie fairy suddenly decided that fantasy market projections would not serve a particular set of games, which so coincidently happened to be part of the same bet, at the same time? What do you take me for?'again, just told me to read the terms and conditions. This Ladies & Gentlemen, is how this Company operates. They'll take your money, offer you sweet deals and enticing features but behind the scenes everything is setup to make sure you are shafted, and even on the cusp of winning they've insidiously installed AI measures to search for and shut down any facility that could enable a potentially high payout. Avoid using their digital setup, it's corrupt as f***! If you're going to use Ladbrokes, go to the shops, pay cash and use paper. My strong advice though, is go elsewhere! If this is how they've organised their systems to implement that kind of corrupt s**t to scam a punter as the nature of that business, they do not deserve any.",1
2020-01-11,After deciding to reopen my account which haven't use online for 12 years I spent 90 minutes on the phone phone to for foreigners who had difficulty understanding me.. eventually we established new passwords and username I decided to put £200 in the account but it immediately froze they said they wanted more ID.. this wasn't bad enough I went in the shop to place a cash bet and told my grid card was frozen as well.. I just tried again got yet another foreigner... He couldn't understand me when I gave him my email address despite spelling it out twice then he struggled with my mobile number I apologised and told him I had to ring off. When complaining to customer services I was told I was rude because I don't want foreigners answering my call I spent 100 minutes talking to people that should not be answering complicated matters if they're English is not up to scratch.. no wonder Ladbrokes has collapsed in the last few years I'm told the call centre is in another country.

I had a mail from Ladbrokes this week titled 'Important account Information'. I short this stated that I would no longer be eligible for odds boost and acca insurance. So shorter odds and no money back as a 'free' bet. Effectively they change the conditions for those who are winning knowing that no one would accept this with so many bookies offering a better deal. What they are doing is getting rid of people who are winning. Keep in mind I was only 160 pounds in profit. I've closed my account. I think it's time that this company was investigated",1

2019-12-18,I have been gambling for 30 plus years and never in my life have I experienced customer service so bad as today the 17th of Dec 2019 in a ladbrokes shop in Cardiff. Now I have previously reviewed the same shop about 8 weeks ago. In the initial review 8 weeks ago I highlighted that the customer toilets were out of use and that 2 of the display monitors were faulty. Well 8 weeks on the toilets have be sorted but no joy in sorting the 2 faulty screens. When I worked for ladbrokes it would be the responsibility of the shop manager cashier to report any faults. It has now come to the point that not only do I have to write this review but I will probably have to phone up customer services to report the poor service tomorrow. Apart from the faulty display screens x2 there was an issue with the updating of results. This has been happening quite frequently and to top it all you got ask them the cashier manager to stock up betting slips namely the numbers for the bingo. I was only permitted to bet lucky dips. What the hell is going on with this shop in Clifton Street Cardiff.,1
2019-12-18,"The staff at  Great Wyrley  are pretty much on the  ball  well  done , However what let the shop down  is the the fact it is shut on a number of occasions  due to a lack of  staff , I personally blame  Ladbrokes, for a total disrespect  to  loyal staff  , Hence the reason no staff to run the shop , Do us all a favour close the shop  , Many thanks  to all staff at Great Wyrley ,",1

So far so good.....until Ladbrokes clawed back the winnings due to an error they made on their odds (should have been 1.02, not 1.5 as agreed on my bet slip). Appreciate errors do happen and are normally corrected before the game starts but to make the correction after they deposited the winnings into my account is unethical - they just make up the rules as they go - always check the small print - punter made profit - bookie not happy - let’s change the outcome so bookie makes a very small loss.I only opened my account with them this week and had 5 straight wins (no loses) - I withdrew my full balance and will be staying with my trusted “small” number of bookmakers.",1

2019-11-19,"I do not recommend ever using this website I just had the worst experience with a gambling website in my life.On the 9th of November 2019, I put down a bet of 50 pounds for the KSI vs Logan Paul which if KSI won i would win 165 pounds in return. after putting in the money i tried opening Ladbrokes an hour before the event, it says that my account is currently frozen and it needs to be further verified for security reasons. but i placed the bet before that so it means that the 50-pound bet that i put before should have counted and i rightfully deserved it no matter what if the outcome of the fight was in my favour. so I was calm and sent over the documents they requested. so I sent my bank details of me and my new house not realizing that it's not the address for Ladbrokes my mistake, they did not inform me about this until I contacted them which is terrible... I admit I was wrong but they should've told me I sent the wrong one so I could at least hurry and send the correct documents.  i explained that i have moved so from the adress that i used to open the account back in 2018. skip 10 days to 19 of November 2019 and i am just amazed how bad the service is. they told me out of nowhere that my account is now permanently closed because of business reasons. I failed to check the security test 3 times? no i failed once and sent the correct documents several times but they did not comply and was always taking forever to contact me back, when I called them they said that oh we received the documents just give us 72 hours which I did and they still did not give me any information on anything until I had to contact them. I have evidence that I sent everything to them and about the placement of the bet. now they are telling me they will only return the money I deposited and I am not entitled to get the money/winnings that were in my account which I rightfully deserved when I placed that bet. I am just so disappointed at their service I really thought they were a good gambling website and now I'm left feeling scammed.

Passwords kept becoming ""invalid"", to the extent last weekend that I couldn't log in at all to check what bets I had already placed!!!After many ""live chats"" and calls to their customer service dept, resetting my password on Saturday (when they actually managed to successfully get the reset email to me) I requested my account to be closed, and balance returned to me, on Sunday.

(I won't even go into their in-play delay always working in their favour, changing the selection, not just the price, or quoting a price that never seems actually available..)Upon noticing my balance had not been paid back into ""my bank account"" this morning - 5 days after requesting it to be - I called them again to be told the account is ""frozen"", but my balance remains with them. No doubt that would be wiped out under their ""dormant account"" policy, soon. Shysters!Doesn't the Gambling Commission, Gamecare, Ibas.. have anything to say regarding this? What if I were a problem gambler, requesting permanent self exclusion?? Do not gamble for anything except fun and a small loss/win. Do not invest with Ladbrokes.",1

Plenty of slots and the sports book is well laid out and very easy to use.I have never had any problems placing bets , depositing funds into my account or when winning transferring money back into my bank account.On the odd occasion when I have had to contact customer service I've found them polite and adequate. Where they do let you down ( and I suspect this is a primary reason for the majority of their negative reviews ) is their computer software. It's slow , crashes repeatedly and despite the aggravation they must know it causes ,they never apologise or give an explanation. I assume they are arrogant enough not to care. So , if you just want a "" giggle "" bet on a bookie that's easy to use ,when it works Ladbrokes is the one. Which is what I use it for. If you bet more than £50 per week and you want a serious and professional betting arrangement with a bookmaker there's plenty out there.

I thought it must be a one off , but guess what I’m not the only one saying it ,there are hundreds of reviews on here saying the same thing and they aren’t fake unlike the ones giving 5 stars and saying how good ladbrokes are ,I  don’t use their shops as I don’t have a grid card and you don’t get best odds without and I don’t use them online as I’ve self excluded due to losing way too much in the casino, most people expect to maybe at worst deposit £400 and scrape £200 -£250 and take it on the chin or deposit £250 and get £100 back but over £700 and get £30 no other casino out of the whole array of casinos available to use in the whole of the uk and believe me I’ve used every single one probably in the region of 200 plus , you will lose more than you will at any other casino so I would suggest just leave ladbrokes well alone and remember coral are the same company NEVER use ladbrokes or corals .

They are an absolute joke they keep your winnings thinking you will gamble them away . I have been on there chat room and I may as well talk to my cat  .... do not use these robbing &*&€£%$###",1
2019-04-20,Ladbrokes robbed me I tried to cash out it was in process for 1 minute then didn’t let me cash out and 2 minutes later other team scored end up losing everything when I call them up they said they working on the system sounds so rigged don’t bet with this site be careful I have already closed my account or else I might lose all my money.,1
2019-04-20,"Ok blew about £300 yesterday on the horses im quite a big layer  300 ew 500ew etc.So my last bet was £100 on an 11/4 shot went to the counter asked for a price well before the off.well the cashier decided to take another customers bet in front of me then put the price on slip very slowly and you guessed it the race was 10 seconds off by this time .but the machine took the bet and my horse won by 10 lengths and now they say they will not honor the bet as the race was off .so im standing my ground does this mean if my horse had lost they would of refunded me my money??. This was clearly the cashier's fault taking a bet from a customer behind me while I'm trying to get a bet on.Any advice // I'm willing to take this to the small claims court this needs to stop they are taking bets after the off and if you win it's too late and if you lose its legal I'm done with this company this is the second time I've had to fight to get my money, They have lost a big layer.",1

I have spoken to those on chat about my return rates being just 12% after a long period of time playing, and they are saying it is just random. What a load of rubbish. Ladbrokes and coral are the worst, they both allow me to cancel my PERMANENT account suspension, their payout rates are borderline illegal. I'm telling you, when the gambling commissioners assess their site that is the only time they will be fair, the rest of the time they con you because nobody is looking. Cancerous site someone should take them down.",1

2019-04-10,"How can Ladbrokes justify an early morning price on a horse at 8/1 when other bookies quote 16/1 on the same horse , and then the horse ends up at 25/1 , I don't know who does the price's for Ladbrokes but this happens on a regular basis. Someone needs to look at this. One or two points of a difference no problem, but 8-17 is a huge difference especially in accums and lucky 15s etc, not on.",1
2019-04-10,"By far the worst online bookie!! 1. No bonus offers of free bets to existing customers. 2.the worst slots I've ever played, hardly any bonus rounds of features and when you do get a bonus round the payout is pathetic!! I played £60 on one game at 50p a spin, I got ONE bonus round of 10 free spins and got £1.88!!!!!!!! 3. The majority of games don't load of just crash constantly. 4. The majority of the days football games don't become available till about the 10th minute into the game, 5. Cash out is unavailable 90% of the time. 6. The staff on live chat are rude and absolutely useless!! 7. Winning bets take hours to settle, I once waited over a day for a football bet to settle, and it was an English league game!! I could go on and on, the sad thing is about 18 months ago the site was brilliant, lots of casino bonuses and frequent free bets, casino loss bonuses, in 18 months it's gone so downhill, the only consolation for me as a punter is that FOBT stakes are now limited 2 quid so they can't rinse punters with their fixed machines in shop, nothing would make me happier to see Ladbrokes to bust in a few years time due to the FOBT cuts, I used to love Ladbrokes but i now despise them with a passion, my advice to anyone thinking of opening a grid online account is don't do it, they will rinse you left right and centre!!!",1
2019-04-09,"Very very poor service all round. Be aware that when you are offered a cash out,Ladbrokes decide whether you get it or not as they have 'the right' to suspend the offer. Then when you call and raise this they will promise a call back within 72 hours but they will not call and if you email of write on their FB page they reply with generic pointless replies. Use another company,Ladbrokes are just awful",1

2019-03-23,"Ladbrokes has taken over £2000 of my money with no chance of me ever winning anything and they are saying that this is legal.  The money was originally deposited on my account faudulantly but despite this,  Apparently GVC Holdings that own Ladbrokes also own Gala bingo.  As i had previously made a complaint about their on line services i had a marker on my file called a DPA which means i would never have been allowed to withdraw anything.Very strange though on that basis Ladbrokes would let me deposit anything i like with them and they would not tell me until the point of the withdrawal that i would not be able to withdraw.  Surely that can not be legal?I have a call recording of a conversation with a Ladbrokes customer service agent explaing that i would never of actually won anything.  I fully intent to take all of my evidence to the gambelling commision and anywhere else i can think of to remind Ladbrokes they are not above the law, and they can not just take money from people and refuse to return it.Working myself on the phone in a customer service role i find it very shocking how the advisers speak and treat you.",1

I politely insisted the bet was honoured to be told it won't accept yet. I asked Gemma in the Kettering shop to call someone & she refused. I explained i would not leave until the bet was paid & after a smarmy reaction she said they closed at 8:30pm to which i emphasized the police would need to be called in order to remove me. In the end she decided to do her job & called customer services who helped get the bet paid 30 minutes later. Unbelievable attitide & disgusting to have to beg for your winnings. Will NEVER step foot in a Ladbrokes again.,1
2019-03-17,"If I could I will never even give one start. Staffs are arrogant and bad mannered. If you win, they try its best to avoid paying you. The whole system is built around looping somehow. Many times, I try to withdraw my winnings...their system took me around in the loop, won't let me withdraw it. Multiple times, the system ask you verify and after verification still won't let you withdraw cash. Verification is done while join and made thousands of bets still won't let you withdraw. If you call them- they try to avoid by saying they are busy! At the end and frustrate you and ended up make you losing a lot. Avoid Ladbrokes by every means.",1

They then continued to end the conversation without any sort of resolution",1
2019-03-13,Cash outs if available are poor and the wait on bets being settled are a joke win a bet on sky bet it’s settled straight on Ladbrokes it stays on the account as pending withdrawal sometimes for 2 days other companies you can withdraw it immediately and it’s in bank next day take your money in a flash not so keen to payout avoid Ladbrokes as they don’t like paying out straight away and poor cash outs,1

I am all behind self exclusion etc but I was never showing this and I explained if I was going for credit or tax issues I would agree They will use the term looking out but I feel it is getting more intrusive The icing on the cake was the wording of “customer journey” priceless (Threshold limits are continuing to be reviewed and in the near future are anticipated to be reduced, resulting in these types of requests being made earlier in the customer's journey.)Draining the enjoyment out of my hobby and killing the industry I’m waiting for the day you can only have a set amount limit on each bet so the house controls everything This already happens a lot eg party poker why are they allowed to open a sports book but don’t take a bet You try to put £50 on an even money shot and they offer you £6 continually Killing it for the people who enjoy a bet",1

On confirmation thereof, Ticketmaster said they wanted to thank me for the purchase and offered me a Bonus Bet with Ladbrokes if I signed up which I did. The deal offered was ""Deposit $50 and we'll add $150 in Bonus bets to your account"". This did not happen, despite me jumping thru all the required hoops. I called Ladbrokes advising what had happened and was advised the offer was not available to me as I lived in WA. They knew this from the start and thus wasted my time trying to co-erce me into becoming a member with them under false pretence. Is this not illegal? When I declined and said I'd rather close the account I had opened an hour earlier, Ladbrokes advised that my initial deposit would be returned to me in 5 days time. What con artists!

Apparently it was a new guy working and he made a mess of putting the bet on in time (manager was outside smoking at the time). I asked for the to check the cameras as I had placed the bet in good time. Phoned up and they said after review I could get my stake back and not allowed to watch the film.

2018-12-22,"I'm not sure I understand Ladbrokes business model. I've had an account with them for over 30 years and had no problems, but recently had a few small wins net profit about £100 on the greyhounds and all of a sudden my bets are restricted..... to ridiculous stakes of amounts like £1.67. They also mentioned I could no longer use any of their promotions which is not really that big a deal given they don't seem to offer much to existing customers anyway. The strange thing is that they have notices saying that they will lay any horse to win up to £5k in their offices and yet I can only get £3.33 on a 5/2 shot. The manager at my local Ladbrokes is embarrassed by these so called trader deals as he believes that the traders should just be better at pricing and take any losses on the chin. However it's all had the effect that they probably want in me betting with other companies. The industry needs a code of Conduct really so that a bookmaker has to lay bets to any of their account holders up to a £200 win.

I find this trustpilot  site very helpful so it's actually good that I can now share my experiences too.I'm not here to whine and moan like a little bxtch I just want to write an honest review. I understand how the industry works. Profit is everything.I had a Ladbrokes account set up a few years back. Never used, never verified. Logged in the last day as I wanted to try the site. Decided I would verify my profile before depositing. Used the secure form...heard nothing until they emailed me asking me to send ID again - via email. I said I would when I found the time - they said there was a huge backlog in the secure form so it would be quicker this way.Anyways they were emailing me and calling my mobile for the next 3 days trying desperately to get me to verify. Eventually I did when I had a spare hour and to be fair they emailed me within 24 hrs saying account was verified.Logged in last night at 22.05 and deposited 5 euro to try the site. It is a bit slow to log in and overall I wasn't that happy with how sluggish it was compared to Bet365 or PP for example. Anyways i placed 50 cent on a US horse 6/5 favorite and 50 cent on a horse running the next day at 3/1. Thought nothing more of it and went to bed - unimpressed by the site and not planning on adding my card anytime soon. Logged in this morning to my email account to find the Dear John letter(sent last night at 2300) informing me I will no longer be offered any free bets, promotions, best odds etc. No worries as I never asked for any freebets or favors. Having logged in now I can see that i can win a maximum of 60 euro on all UK horse races and less on football/tennis etc. That is actually fine i rarely ever bet more than a couple of euro anyways so it doesn't affect me. So that is that - fair play Ladbrokes you are entitled to refuse business with who you want. I am just a little surprised as you were so desperate to get me to verify and after two 50 cent bets on two favorites I am heavily restricted. PP,Whill and 365 both restricted too - maybe these guys are like one of those notorious rings we often hear about -  and share data amongst other things - who knows?I just had to come on here and write a review so anyone contemplating joining this site can know what to expect. I suppose my advice would be - if you decide to join just stick in the minimum deposit 5euro and use it for a while. If they haven't restricted you after a few days of betting maybe verify and deposit more - because there is no point wasting time sending in documents and debit cards when your account can be gubbed within minutes.Merry Christmas you Filthy Animals!Danny",1
2018-12-05,terrible esp. the staff at Glasgow saltmarket branch  wont ever use them all you seem to hear is very poor newspaper reports about Ladbrokes for example in the guardian newspaper even there games are diabolical better bookmakers out there than Ladbrokes apparently even there method of operation   is very poor I would recommend that  you avoid at all costs not good not good  anyhow I think most people know this the ladbrokes shop in saltmarket glasgow certain member of staff very problematic to customers male aged between 24 and 35 over 6ft in height with a very odd looking appearance  and very rude and frankly should be sacked i think he resides in the Hamilton area of south lanarkshire wont ever use them,1
2018-12-04,"It has the worst online platform for websites and mobile applications. Its slow, unreliable and terrible. I use bet365 and you just can't compare the fluidity of the latter with the crappiness of the ladbrokes applications. They need to do something about this because they have appealing varieties of options for bets. Just find a good developer please, if you are trying to keep costs down and not working to improve better experiences for your customers, you will loose lots of customers.",1
2018-12-04,Criminal organisation. They are stealing money. Lot of botplayers at poker. They are CRIMINALS,1
2018-12-04,Some games never gives anything on selected stakes however regarding to Ladbrokes all works and checked but they don’t know why never gives anything back so fixed slot games and scam because nobody wins!! Customer Service reply only if you are lucky 🍀 since coral involved gone more worst but there’s many others to waste money believe me but not on here!!,1
2018-12-03,Changed my bet AFTER and told me repeatedly “it in our terms and conditions” . What to change a bet ?  I selected 3 games to score over 1.5 goals all with the cash out option . Placed my bet and about 10 mins into the first game it was already 2-0 so a third had already won and other 2 games yet to start. I noticed cash out was unavailable with the notice saying “ bets placed with a free bet cannot be cashed out” but i didn’t bet with a free bet! Called customer service and they said once I placed my bet Ladbrokes added a £5 free bet to my account so the cash out was removed ! ? There was no warning ! I tried to get the bet void even though I was winning but NO. How can that be fair as my bet was not what i selected ? How am I supposed to know they would randomly give me a free bet AFTER ? By removing the cash out they increased their chances of not paying out. Next stop my local paper,1
2018-12-03,"i closed my account - they don't pay out a penny on their slots/casino - no matter how much you play - its fixed - same games on william hill , gala casino/slots, betfair and many others you win some you lose some - no ladbrokes - totally fixed",1

I would really like to warn people to stay away from Ladbrokes as they are trouble makers. They don't warn you when taking a bet that you are betting late, but if you win will not pay out.We go to bookies to play fairly and not to look for problems. But at ladbrokes, they will create problems.Stay clear of Ladbrokes.",1

2018-11-28,"Avoid-better options elsewhereI have been using Ladbrokes along with Skybet for the last couple of years but started to favour Ladbrokes more during the 2018 football world cup as they had some decent offers (bet up to £10 on certain markets and if your bets lose then get a free bet to the same value). I have done ok on the account, sometimes winning, sometimes losing and not just staking money when a free bet was available. I am probably in the region of £200 to £300 up since the beginning of the world cup.These offers have continued up to today,  when I got an email informing me that I will no longer be eligible for any promotional offers including standard ones on the website such as those related to accumulators.  The email informed me that I am likely to still receive emails advertising them but they will not apply to my account.Needless to say the account is now empty and closed, as others have mentioned there are much better companies to do business with. When closing the account their website asked for feedback on the reason. Poor customer service was one of the options but it would not allow this as a selection without also having them call to discuss. I wonder how many people put the option of ""I would prefer not to say"" as I did when this appeared. It appears that their own feedback system which should help to drive improvements is also poorly thought out.I will continue to use Skybet, their site is better along with the other links such as Super 6 and Fantasy 6 a side, from my experiences with them they also value their customers which is more than I can currently say for Ladbrokes.",1
2018-11-25,"This is the most untrustworthy company i have ever had the misfortune to be involved with, sent me emails saying if i placed a £10 bet on any sport my account would be immediately credited with 2×£5 free bets.

Phoned them and was waste of time woman said she could'nt see my name on the list , told her to close my account wich she seemed more interested in and she closed it i think she actually got a kick out of it. Dont know how this company is actually still running as since they merged with Coral it's just one problem after another i am going to report them to Trading Standards.",1
2018-11-22,"I placed a bet for my brother in error, tried to get it voided before it had started but it was denied",1
2018-11-22,"Having being placed in their top class Ladbrokes Premier Scheme in 2014 they couldn’t do enough, inviting me on Hospitality to big horse racing events and offering lots of ‘loyalty’ bonuses. Calling me regularly asking me to deposit £10k in order to receive a £1000 Casino bonus on several ocassions. This of course all comes in exchange for depositing thousands and wagering hundereds of thousands of pounds on a regular basis.After Ladbrokes merged with Coral, this scheme became more and more diluted over subsequent years and the offers seemed to become more focussed on the sportsbook side as opposed to gaming. Such as if you lost £250 in a particular horse race you would get a refund in the form of a free bet to use on another race. Up until Monday 19th November 2018 I was getting text messages as often as 4x per day advising me to deposit and claim these offers. Unfortunately at the weekend I lost on several races but got the £250 free bet refund from a race on Saturday, placed the free bet on another race later the same day and it won at 6-1. I wasn’t aware at the time but this must have been a best odds guaranteed race as the payout turned out to be £2,000. I’d like to say I was excited about this win but I wasn’t as it seems very rare to actually win anything these days and in all honesty it barely covered what had been lost in previous months.On Monday morning I received an email from a VIP manager stating I have been removed from the VIP scheme indefinitely with no real explaination as to why, other than that they need to strike a balance as to what customers are offered for their loyalty which would suggest I’m not making them enough money. Later that afternoon I got an email from Coral who I haven’t even placed a bet with since 2013 let alone claimed anything saying I wouldn’t be entitled to any free bets, best price or concessions ever again. In addition any future bets I place with them are likely to be stake limited. Then on Tuesday afternoon I got the same email from Ladbrokes. I withdrew all my funds which to their credit have been paid without fuss or delay. I have been told I am welcome to still use my restricted account, however that will not be happening when there are better companies out there who treat customers more fairly.When on Hospitality with Ladbrokes I had a number of concerns, they will give you loan of an iPad whilst you are there so you can play their slots and casino games. This is an environment where you are plied with unlimited free alcoholic drinks, and there is also betting facility directly in the room where you can watch the event from an open balcony to tempt you into doing spare of the moment bets. I recall one event where a gentlemen in his late 50s was sat at a table playing high stakes 3 card brag online. We had all been invited to watch horse racing and he didn’t go out to the balcony to watch a single race. He was just sat there gambling on the tablet the whole time!. Where was the social responsibility?.The hosts I met at events were always very polite, kind, courteous and friendly but sadly, as a company it is more than clear that Ladbrokes deliberately and manipulatively groom customers into being long term losers and if you do not fit that profile they will adjust the offering until you are then if you still don’t fit that profile they will cripple your account on discriminatory terms but this attitude to customers is legal and is all in the terms and conditions so they have done nothing wrong. It is a business at the end of the day and if you aren’t profitable they won’t want you.In my opinion it is morally bankrupt to be able to run a book and offer games with built in edges that GUARANTEE the company will always make money from customers whilst simultaneously skewing the offering so that it makes even more money and the customer can’t achieve anything other than to ultimately lose. The Gambling Commission??, they have no interest in safe, responsible and fair gambling it’s purely there to pick up taxes and all that has happened to gambling in the UK since regulation is a poorer deal for the consumer and even more corruption!",1

2018-10-12,"Having read all the reviews and experienced awful daylight robbery over and over on their slots i decided it's time to make a stand, last night I filmed nearly 2 hours of slots gameplay and it didn't dissapoint, hardly any reel  wins on 4 different games and hardly any bonuses, on one game i staked 60 quid at 25p a spin and not one single feature! The game was Halloween fortunes 2, PLEASE do not play this game!!! Anyway I made contact with a friend who works for the gambling commission this morning and I have managed to get the video footage of last night's ' daylight robbery ' into the inbox of a senior regulator who's job is to check that online slots are regulated and fairly set, and I'm thrilled that I had an email back tonight saying that having reviewed my footage that something is very clearly a miss and doesn't seem to be set fairly, it needs to be reviewed by other regulators but the guy who emailed me said that if I had any further footage of evidence of foul play to forward it directly to him so I'm asking everybody who has been ' robbed ' on any slot or game to forward your videos/evidence to me at gareth.stone at gmx. Com. We will never succeed at getting them closed down but by providing evidence to the gambling commission we can ensure that we can ruffle some feathers and stop Ladbrokes greedy ceo's like jim mullen lining their pockets at our misfortunes and hard earned money, I have been gambling for 17 years and I'm well aware that I'm not guaranteed to win every time BUT I feel i have a right to a FAIR gamble and Ladbrokes slots are not providing that and haven't been for quite a while now. I'm a police community support officer and I'm not just a moaning punter, I'm taking this very seriously and I urge people who have suffered like I have to finally stand up, complaining on here and to their ' agents ' on live chat gets you nowhere but complaining to the gambling commission something can be done, if you have had enough then take a stand people, you have the right to a FAIR gamble when you play.",1
2018-10-09,"Ladbrokes regularly change the terms and conditions of there promotions without giving the customer prior notice which incidentally make no sense anyway here’s the explanation I was given as to why I was not entitled to the acca insurance promotion.

Your bet ID O/165722242/0000477 was placed on October 6th and the last match on PSG vs Lyon was scheduled on 07-10-2018 at 20:00:00 while your other bet ID O/165722242/0000479 was placed on October 7th and the last match on Valencia vs Barcelona was scheduled on 07-10-2018 at 19:45:00.On your first bet, you've already had one losing selection before the last match started which means in the event that you have lost the last match then it will no longer qualify for the offer but you did qualify for it after the last game results. On the second bet, you almost had a winning bet but unfortunately, it was a lost match which then qualify you for the offer. Both of the bets were confirmed to be qualified on the same date after the result of the last match have been confirmed but since your second bet was the first one that was confirmed to have qualified, you will only received the free bet on this one.",1

2018-08-12,"was ripped off,robbed by one of their employees so i contacted them with full details of incident,witnesses names even what i should have recieved..anyway..what did Ladbrokes do?NOTHING Well technically thats not completely true..i got an email...said email said full investigation had taken place and nothing had come to light...so what was this ""investigation""? Did they question/interview anyone? Oh they did yes...the person who ripped me off...she said ""i didnt do it"" (a la Bart Simpson) and they said ""we are satisfied investigation over"" Now id like to thank Ladbrokes for the effort they put into resolving this issue i mean i realise it must have taken hours and hours to get to the bottom of this..that said though as a former employee of said company nothing about them suprises me anymore..ive heard staff tell customers to F off, other members of staff betting,playing machines,hell i saw shop managers cover up cash differences,members of staff getting away with theft (on at least two occasions) and when i mentioned these i was told that i was the trouble maker...ive seen Ladbrokes from both sides of the counter and let me tell you its rotten...if Ladbrokes ever tell you ANYTHING online or in shop make sure you double then treble checked then have it independently analysed..don't be fooled by the happy smiley funny(ish) adverts its as corrupt as it comes...finally transpires the person i had made this complaint about was having a fling/affair with a district supervisor..read into that what you will",1

But once you try to withdraw it they wont let you, and they actually 'hold' your money, and the guy on the phone calculated that I need to earn from betting $166 until i can take money out. WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY! DO NOT USE LADBROKES EVER. ITS A SCAM!",1
2018-08-08,Shocking from Ladbroke once again football acc can't cash out as it says its a free bet. When it was put on with my own money. Customer service no help. Dont bet with this company go with another SHOCKING,1
2018-08-05,"""Trading"" dept will close or limit your account to 1-2£ bets if you dare to win. They offer no explanation at all because they don't care. They just want to have customers that are problematic gamblers. Website is terrible and full of bugs. Customer service completely powerless. Generally they couldn't care less about the customer and they are good with it. Occasional good odds cannot justify using this bookmaker since they will literally not let you win.",1
2018-07-31,"Ladbrokes were AWESOME for the first year. Slowly and slowly they showed their true colours. They'd send me many match deposit offers in the first year and some in the 2nd year but ironically I'd be broke half the time they did. Recently in the past couple of years I started taking very high interest in the racing as opposed to just sport betting and I received ONE voluntary offer. They didn't even send me one for my birthday whereas TAB would even though I NEVER used them.When I asked why their reason was bull ""depends on the turnovers, your account"" blah blah blah and I stopped the lady and asked ""so you're telling me in a year its possible for you guys to VOLUNTARILY send me a match deposit?"" She said ""yes""That was it for me. I can't stand liars who are on top of that tight asses when apparently Ladbrokes are close to signing a $200 000 000 deal with MGM. Not only did I receive NO VOLUNTARILY match deposits but even when I asked for one (I'd ask for one at least every 2-3 months) I only got 2 last year and 1 this year. Not even for my birthday.I was with Ladbrokes since 2014 and I feel my loyalty was absolutely not only looked passed but also insulted.I've signed up with Crown Bet now and already their customer service is also better. Tom was more than happy to help and was very polite. Didn't feed me bull. Was upfront and nice.Don't bet with Ladbrokes. The first year may be good heck maybe even the second year too... But eventually they will forget their loyal customers and be rude to them by lying for their reason as to why they could not show a little appreciation by sending me a voluntary match deposit here and there (in 2 years)!!",1
2018-07-28,"I won £20 on the Grand National, shortly afterwards they locked my account saying that I hadn't verified it. I now have to go through a process including sending documents to try and get my account unlocked. I asked if I can just close the account, which they said no problem but when I asked if that included my winning, the answer was no just your initial £5 bet. This is my first go at online betting and I'm not a betting man, but I guess the odds of getting my winnings are astronomical. Go with an online betting company you can trust, Ladbrokes doesn't appear to be one .",1
2018-07-25,"Con. No other way to describe this company. Advert pops up online with odds that are very attractive and apparently for new customers. So you sign up, deposit money then find out the odds have changed significantly. Money refunded but landed a cash transaction fee from my credit card company as a result. I'm out of pocket for being misled.",1

Have to deposit minimum of £5 in your account before betting £1 to win £21, however can only use the winnings for free bets. Misleading ads to lure you in and take your money. F*k outta here rubbish mate.",1
2018-07-15,When you win the bet does not come up on the system. I had to call them to get this resolved but last time and the time before I always made bets and won however it never showed up on my history and my money was taken and never given back. Do not use this company. It lures you with false adverts explaining how good their deals are however when you actually win it’s deleted from the history your money is taken and you cannot do anything for the money to be refunded,1
2018-07-15,I went to do a bet for france to win the world cup. I was told if I bet £5. I will only win £9. I was then told you can do a bet 2-1 for france to win. I said what If I bet £100 for france to win. I was told the terms and conditions are complicated.I am so stupid I should have questioned him and said what do you mean. Me being stupid accepted when I was advised to do a bet for £10 for france to win 2-1 then I will could £100. I just wanted to do a bet for france to win the world cup.now I feel like he cheated me to do a bet I was not interested in. If I did a bet for france to win world cup somewhere else I would have guaranteed a win. I told him this was my first time I am doing a bet and I feel like he used that against me to cheat me. I would advise people to go elsewhere and don't use ladbrokes. I wish I read the comments first.,1

2018-07-09,"Not worth using if you like to have a gamble. If you get lucky and win a few times, they just restrict your account to pathetic stakes. They offer the boosted odds, but like I already mentioned, if you win a few bets, they just restrict your account until you can no longer bet reasonable sums of money. Terrible website design too. You're better using other bookies and not wasting your time with these cowboys. That's if, like me, you want to gamble with more than a fiver...",1

2018-07-07,"Signed up because of an offer  I saw on Facebook, during sign up I didn't enter the offer code, so I didn't get it, but then I was told by a rep that they can manually enter the code for me, as long as I place a bet.Happy to do so as I was betting on the England match today, issues with finding the bet for England to win, yes I am a newby and I want to play it safe! As I'm looking for the right bet, the connection dropped so I reconnect to a new person called Merry and she was like no you can't get this, offer because you already signed up. I explained that one of her tema already said it was ok and after minutes later she said that's fine, and she will be able to add the code if I place a bet, when I said I'm having issues finding the England to win bet she was like you can't bet on that for the F50 offer.Told her that her colleague was helping me find the bet before so obviously it's ok to bet on for the F50 offer.She spewed something about because I didn't enter the code during signup, I can't bet, which brings us back to me saying the person I spoke to before said she will add it manually and we kept on going in circles until she just ended the chat in mid chat.It's a real shame as it's my first time using a betting app and Ladbrokes' app was good to use.

We ended with the session with only 1 feature which gave us a win of £9.00.  Only other wins we had were 50p and the next highest was a fiver.  100 spins with a payout of of a total of about £12.00.   These machines should be taken out.  1 person near us kept feeding his machine with no wins.  BAN THESE FOTBs and see how long LADBROKES last on the high street,1

There must be a ladbrokes on every high street in the UK but they cannot even pay out £650 that I won 3 weeks ago. Appalling customer sevice and I have been made the same promises again and again. Endless emails and calls. Also after 2 months of playing I think that their slots are rigged. This is a scam and I will be reporting them to the gambling commission.,4
2018-04-18,Well thats been 2 month once every week went in put about 360 in the machines and picked a coulor and started off small then lost then put the bet up every time to double the bet each time on the machines and guess what 8 times going in and staking bets its either been red red red red red red red red red red red or black black black black black black black black when picking the other coulor 8 x in 2 months on same day come on if the goverments dont regulate them and the shops regulate them self and we need to complain to them when they do not do nothing then they are guilty as much as the shops its not random at all they take take take take take they should be banned  or they should put live roulette on the machines to make random and not a programmed machine to take it all out on one player with out a win and its funny how it resets how much u put in every time u want to put over a 50 pound bet in the machine its time every one now boycotts the bookies and do not use them. Its also funny how when u question the machines they try fob u off to say if u are gambling to much then u should contact gamblers anonymous i been playing for the past 8 weeks to prove there rigged and i thing with the camera shot i have gathered is enough to prove tell u what if i win the euro millions on friday im gonna put every penny into getting them machines banned to protect people from being robbed as the chances of getting the same results every week is just like winnging the lottery,1

2018-02-27,"As an experienced Betting Shop Manager for over 26 years and someone who loves to bet on horse racing, going into Ladbrokes is a nightmare and the one star rating sums up their service. I have to say I speak through my pocket, I use to visit their shops when the managers and staff understood a bit of racing and settling bets, now I am sorry to say it is a waste of time and I don't bother. Perhaps something for the management to think about. once those FOBT's stop accepting large amounts of money they may need to retrain their staff to look after the customers who have carried their business over the years.",1

Lets say you deposit £20. It will swallow up that deposit, no matter what game you play on. The same will happen with your next deposit, but it may last a fraction longer, but never get you near what you have put in. When you complain to customer services, they blame the whole thing on you. You have a gambling problem they say. Oh sorry, the fact the games rob you blind, is my fault. They honestly pay only 5 or 6percent. Dont trust these shisters, the whole gaming site is rigged. Ive made approxiamately 20 deposits totalling over a grand in the last week and only played at small stakes, but not one occasion was i in a position to stop when in front.

Spoke to the ""customer service"" person and they said it was down to the traders to void any games etc that have been abandoned. I did tell them that the game in question had been abandoned 10 mins in but they just didn't care. They then got a bit cheeky and told me that I have a gambling problem and I should seek help. With this I withdrew my money and closed my account with them. Bloody cheeky as owt. Complaint going to IBAS also. To sum up.They are poor at best and should be avoided.

Where they get these dead heads from, on customer service, is anyone's guess?? When you ask them to resolve an issue, they ask for screenshots of the offers, ID of qualifying bets and terms and conditions of the offer??? Today I gave them all the information they required, was put on hold for over 40 minutes and then was told they couldn't add the free bet because 'they didn't have the tools to do so??'

2017-11-25,"As a problem gambler this site has caused me a massive problem (I accept that my actions are my own):-• Given my propensity to reverse pending withdrawals, they delayed withdrawals up to 5 days before processing.• Allowed me to lose a six figure sum in my young daughters name before even querying the losses.• Blatantly kept my account open after I requested self exclusion.  Even said in their reply to me ""I hope this e-mail finds you well"" as they prevaricated on my request!!!!! • All other operators complied with the same request.All in all a very shoddy approach by one of our biggest operators.  Social responsibility by their interpretation would appear, at least in my experience, identify the vulnerable and take them to the cleaners.

2017-08-24,"Ladbrokes ....tu tu tu please don't make me laugh!! Where shall I start? Let's start with the customer service at the TULSE HILL LONDON branch ! Every time I go to this shop   it's nothing but a time bomb nearly every member of staff is always in a conversation on their mobile phone if not in convoy then viewing some social media profile. The attitude of the so called manager is disgusting  the language  being used by this individual is somewhat   shocking to the core, responses  to customers  queries ( including myself ) is shocking.Ladbrokes prides  itself  by being the one and only betting site whom took it upon itself  to place a none promotional  TV add dedicated  to problem gambling but in my eyes this only smacks them rite in the face with a load of horse dung leisurely  deposited  by the fine stallions at various  locations  on various  race tracks  up and down the great  British  Isles .This comes from my beliefs  that when you are so lucky ( if you ever are that may be ) to have a win then the process of withdrawing  such funds is disgusting,  not only does this enable the funds to be withdrawn back to your account  in a time frame between  3 and 5 working days but also allows people who may of developed  a gambling problem to spend those funds and inevitably  walk away with nothing. AT SKY AND GALA the funds once withdrawn can not be touched until it reaches your chosen  withdrawal  method and in past experiences  that's usually the next day! SO LADBROKE  WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID WITH YOUR BULL? SHAME ON YOU!!",1

2017-08-10,"Been with Ladbrokes yrs. In shop no problems but last 3/4 mths on/line have has a raw deal to say the least. Winnings. Bonuses, etc. What a struggle to collect what you've won fair and square. No sense of emotions with agents on /line. Management no better. Treated like a number tbh,  no feeling or common sense used by staff,  some actually bordering on arrogance  Monies and bonuses refused on technicalities or worded differently but don't state it actually in promotions..  Have lost thousands but not a bad loser,  final straw came today when was refused 2x£5 bonuses. Offer stated spend £5 and if roulette ball lands in zero collect £5 bonus. Had some fun lost my £6 but landed on zero x2. Wouldn't pay as I'm supposed to understand that every spin has to be £5 not just £5 over 20 mins.  Asked them were it states that, reply was that's what it means. Incredible...  Lost a very good customer.  Ladbrokes not recommended online one IOTA. Stay clear of.. Niger Griffiths.",1

2017-07-29,"Most peoples complaints seem to be about Ladbrokes not honouring or paying bets. I have to say, I have been using Ladbrokes for a couple of years and have never had such problems. My issue is with the functionality of the website. It is just dreadful. To check your account you need to login to a separate section of the site. Then if you want to place a bet you have to logout and login again to be able to do so. Why?? The site also regularly logs you out for no reason.And I have never known a website be down for so many times. Try and log in most mornings and you get ""down for routine maintenance"". Website down again this morning due to ""technical issue"". On a busy sporting Saturday!I have found most of the other major players in the industry have far more reliable and easier to use websites. Also they generally give better odds than Ladbrokes.",2

When I phoned to say why have you not honoured your bet, they said ""its part of our terms and conditions, we had offered the wrong odds in play"" I'm sorry, in my fathers day that would be  called dishonesty from a bookie and no one would go near them, but apparently not. I mean it wasn't 180/1 it was 18/1. They just didn' think it would happen and she a ton of people put their hard earned cash on, they didn't want to pay it. Are they saying this multi billion pound organisation only has one set of eyes and keyboard tapping fingers working on an in play board. I don't think so. So I dont believe them...... its  fecking cheating and I will never use them again.they ruin the fun of the punt. Peeved off of Littlehampton.",1

2017-07-10,Tried to leave negative feedback on ask gamblers about ladbrokes but they removed my review so they aren't an independent entity they probably get paid by bookies so can't allow bad reviews .Anyway I'll start here I was amazed to see another reviewer with exactly the same complaint and exactly the same comment regarding the % payout of the slots which can't be regulated by the ukgc as like the other reviewer said and was surprised over £200 and no bonus or free spins . I deposited £450 and on my last £10 I won about £70 the max my balance went to was £86 after depositing £450 every reputable casino on this planet would at least let you win half or three quarters back for you to say ok I've lost x amount of pounds be it £100 or £200 but £450 I've never lost that much at any other casino other than the progress play casinos and I've joined every casino on this planet . What makes this worse is just reopened account after self excluding for 5 years this casino will take take take take almost to the point of unbelievability probably set the same payout levels as the In shop machines 100% this is the worst payout percentage of any online casinos - I know it's a game of chance but there's no chance of winning here ended up withdrawing £68 and calling it a day Why bother getting a grid card and joining up when betfred do 12 bog races a day treble odds 1 winner for l15s and bog between 12 - 130 and  5-6 This is probably one of the bookies under investigation by the ukgc regarding unfair bonuses being applied to deposits causing you to have to play winnings over 30 times by which time you lose it all,1

2017-07-06,I have been a customer for ladbrokes for many years and am dissatisfied  with the way the the staff laugh and make coments when the person loses. As for the £2 voucher code for free play is a waist of my time as you doint get anything back it incorages people to place more so that the staff get there bonuses what about people getting a bonus? No ladbrookes rip people off how about people rip them off? Oh they would not like that a discussing place!!!!!!!,1
2017-07-01,Placed bet utilising BOG at Ladbrokes Stirchley Birmingham for Windsor 245.  Horse won-happy days especially as sp was greater than early priceUpon collection was informed only half the stake would be settled at BOG and the remainder at early price???Ladbrokes member of staff agreed with discrepancy but stated could only pay what was showing on their system He contacted customer service twice but they refused to accept responsibility or even acknowledge mistake.  I was handed phone on one occasion and when asked to speak to senior manager was informed rules were rules and decision was final-what nonsense!Staff should make punters aware of this at the point of placing bet therefore you know exactly what your doing and advertised appropriatelyThe only marketing was for BOG and how far ahead Ladbrokes are in terms of competitive pricing compared to the competition Please heed my advice avoid this bookie as they refuse to accept responsibility for mistakes of their own doing and the customer service experience I received was a joke and somewhat surreal-avoid at all costs-you've been warned!!,1

2017-06-11,Terrible company. Once you start winning you are banned or heavily restricted with them! Ladbrokes should lose their license to be a UK bookmaker as they clearly are not one! Any UK bookmaker that refuses or restricts a punter's bet should not be allowed to continue just because that punter has a winning account. Ban Ladbrokes and do Britain and all punters a favour!,1

2017-06-06,"OMG have sent emails to the following Jim Mullen CEO Ladbrokes corals mat Chapman at the races and the racing post. Obviously after reading all reviews it is prove that Jim Mullen gets a salary for doing nothing and it is proof of Ladbrokes closure being sold to corals.  After last night debacle where Ladbrokes technical staff played a joke on all its customers I presume by giving an unofficial result 8.10 at Windsor awesome Alan being first  on a race that Ladbrokes cannot give a live stream too , instead they give a virtual reality commentary with pictures and gave an unofficial result of my horse winning and on the strength of that , knowing I had winnings coming back , I had a further bet on another race only to find out that the jokers in the technical staff at Ladbrokes could not be bothered to write unofficial photo instead of unofficial winner.  I have had no apology nor recompense after years of my loyality to this company. I have asked them To close my account with them and corals.  I hope Mr Mullen can look in the mirror and think he has done a good job and would advise to anyone thinking of opening an account with these two companies to seriously think again.  I would hope that corals is the next one to be sold. I am totally and utterly disgusted whatever Mr Mullen is being paid not worth it in my eyes. Run for the hills betting shop everyone Andy",1

Refund please then close my account. Have had 0 wins since i joined and there is so many complications when it comes to depositing money it vanishes into thin air. Its funny how you can deposit with no probs but to speak to someone or even play is impossible. The website is also the most complicated nonsense i have ever come across.

In short I have found them dishonest, deliberately misleading and with customer service that couldn't give two s**ts.Got a free bet for joining that didn't rollover after placing the bet - this wasn't clear. Secondly the free bet is not included in the returns despite the betting slip clearly showing it would be.Thirdly contacted customer service and they were useless. Told me that's how it works and it is my problem. Finally they then failed to do what I asked them to do and closed the live chat mid conversation.Useless and cheats.

Completely understand there are laws they need to adhere to, particularly relating to money, however, I feel that when requesting this kind of information there should be some explanation, even if brief. I also received poor responses via email which led me to believe I could go into the shopto withdraw however when I went into the shop, I was again refused causing embarrassment.

2017-02-28,hi david was good help from games. Ladbrokes can be on the tight side sometimes especially which sportsbook but hey they can hold there heads high as they are not scum like corals. Atleast they sort you out a bit which i appreciate whereas corals just look to do you over where possible.,4

2017-02-18,Went into a Ladbroke shop in Glasgow to put on football coupon. While there saw a dog race about to go off so placed a bet. Bet accepted and money taken. While writing out football coupon my dog race bet comes up a winner so foolishly increase football bet. Go up to desk to collect my dog winnings and told no winnings as bet put on too late. Winnings only £32 ( not life changing ) but why let me go through elation of thinking I have won and then tell me I haven't. Other bookmakers let you know then and there when placing bet which is acceptable. Bad bad form Ladbrokes will be giving all my money to William Hills from now on!!,1

2017-02-11,"Bookies may be FUN for a few, but for the Majority that book makers entirely rely upon they are all very much the SAME.Inside their shops they now by LAW have to display WARNING ⚠ SIGNS that say ""WHEN THE FUN STOPS- STOP"".Instead they have found alternative ways to make you feel Comfortable and that Fair Play is what it's all about .My case is clearly to do with the CORALS CONNECT CARD. Your friendly shop staff are ordered to get you signed up to it which is what I did on 16 June 2016 in Exeter.I'd only just moved to the area.I had absolutely no idea 💡 about the so called ""FULL BENEFITS"" it had in now having one up until around 10 days ago.I was in a local Corals and for a rare change my luck was up 👆 with £20 I was for once delighted with my £700 winnings.It was then I enquired about what else does this card do for me.The lovely Mgr explained that I could Deposit funds into it over the counter and Withdraw funds from any Corals shop UK wide.And the card was good while with funds to give me access to their online Casino and Betting Site.I was convinced my funds were SAFE with Corals and from this MOMENT the FUN STOPPED for me.Now leaving the Store with a Receipt of a freshly Deposited £100 cash in my Corals Connect Card, I now had an option at any time of my choosing to try my luck 🍀 online.I checked into their casino site, and was ALL GO to try my LUCK.But then a pop up sign told me i needed to verify the account.I was unaware that my account in fact was already VERIFIED on 16 June by the shop.I sent over my 2 forms of Verification,logged out and woke up the next morning to find an EMAIL from their secretive VERIFICATION DEPARTMENT  stating my CONNECT CARD was now BLOCKED I was no longer able to use it and I would not be welcome to have any new one.No reason given at all by Corals.The same email then informs me not to worry about my newly funded DEPOSIT of £100, I was assured I could return to the store to get MY monies back.I drove the 24 miles to EXETER to enable me to relieve my concerns and take the monies and had by this time all ready decided I would not be ever using a CORALS ever again as they had refused to explain what was wrong, I did eventually hear that i apparently was being accused of having 14 separate accounts opened at the one time.If this were to be true I asked them why on earth didn't Corals phone me to question if I was aware of this.I'm now in the Exeter Store waiting what must of been over one hour.Phone call after phone calls continued and then i was told abrubtely due to the FACT I had taken over £184.00 of funds from my account over and above what I had deposited since June 16 ,2016, they would not be RETURNING my MONIES.at this point my visit to the store became a confrontational on speaker PHONE argument, they refused to accept I had never made ONE deposit into this Connect Card nor ever tried to make any one WITHDRAWAL.Having lived for 28 years with Chronic Illnesses  and leaving London due to 4years of now dealing with acute ANXIETY ATTACKS, I was feeling the strain of not being to far away from the danger of entering into a dark area I did not wish to be in ,especially in a public place which can frighten and alarm others, but while exposing this to the shop staff who were more than kind and sympathetic, the Customer Care Team would not answer my questions of alarm and amazement at the new accusations that I had defrauded CORALS of more than £184.00. The aggregation did not get better and it became apparent to me i was now entering into a full scale ANXIETY FIT/ATTACK inside the store.This invarabely can be TRIGGERED when the sufferer feels entrapped and alone in their feelings and it goes without saying my ANXIETY ATTACKS are impossible once triggered to not cause ALARM by the SCREAMS OF TERROR and ALARM I feel inside, I CRY out loud and my body begins to react in the same way Epilepsy shows when a person suffers an attack.The screams and loud whalling of course will attract Attention from the public and this can intensify the emotional TRAUMA even worse, the where pannic leaves the suffering person with the added problem of not being able to breath, and in my case high blood pressure and the feeling of dying there n then.It's been known for me to actually stop breathing from these acute attacks.Resulting in me being unable to DRIVE home the 24 miles, and in a highly vulnerable state.I did get myself home eventually around 4.30pm after arriving at the store at 10.30 am.The following day still very unwell with continuing body fits I visited both the Mental Health Dr and was strongly advised to see my GP straight away who would provide me with the sedatives required.I remained unwell for 5 days and did not leave the home instead due to my low mental health required friends to come and stay at my home to keep a close watch on me and be on the look out of any signs of deteriation.The issue stands 2 weeks later nearly , I did eventually have my £100 refunded to me but warned I was never WELCOMED to ENTER a CORALS STORE anywhere in the UK again.Today in emailed by MATT ,they never give out their surnames, Matt being a so called Senior Escalation's Manager to inform me he has completed a FULL ENQUIRY into my Case and is satisfied my case is finished with ad CORALS have been so kind and decent to me rewarding me with the Return of what was my money anyway.I Cannot for the LIFE of ME sit down and shut up about CORALS wicked,demeaning and allowance to not be able to play FAIR, treat Customers with Courtesy and not CONTEMPT and then be excused for inviting a known mental disability to ignite due to the repeated aggrevated RHETORIC, the Customer is subjected too.My Case I've emailed across to it's CEO, JIM MULLEN.If they continue to ignore providing evidence that shows me the HISTORY of the USAGE of my VALIDATED and AUTHORIZED CONNECT CARD sinceb16 June 2016, and having a clear understanding of the KEY ROLES of any CEO from any Corporation , I believe my case cleary warrants an answer from his office without fail.It's almost time to Take Serious LEGAL ACTIONS for Damages and make CORALS fully answerable in Law for what appears to be Lawlessness and anything goes Management that again places Profit above People and their well being.Phil M",1

2017-02-09,"Where do I start, just like most of the real reviews on here about Ladbrokes when it comes to them taking your money then they have no issues, but when it comes to getting your cash back, not a hope in hell.Fell for one of their offers 300 free spins, with lots of fake so-called winners saying how much they had wonI thought yeah why not go for it, stuck in my money, signed up andSearched in vain for my free spins, turned out there we no real 300  free spins, you had to play £200 every day to get 10 free spins for upto 30 days.The terms and conditions showing this were well hidden, grey text on black background almost impossible to see and unreadable on a mobile device, shocking as it was a mobile site.As soon as I had been told how it worked I asked them to cancel the account and have my Money back, this was within 10 mins of opening the account, I had not played any games or used any bonus, this was a month ago, the account is inaccessible showing an internal error when I try to log in, support can't fix it and my money is in lala land.My only option now is to complain to the UK gambling commission and  make a claim through the small claims court to get my money back Avoid at all costs and don't fall for their fake offers",1

The bet was not credited at all, I waited until the kick off for the game in question in case it was credited then, it was not. I then went to live chat to rectify the issue. I waited 15 minutes for a response from 'Suzie' after she asked me her first question, I replied with my bet ID to then wait a further 20 minutes with no response to then get an automated reply of 'Customer Support is currently unavailable, please try again shortly.' Considering even if they did rectify the issue of my free bet, the match will probably have finished by the time they get around to it is ridiculous.

2016-11-21,"I bet £100 a week online with Ladbrokes and it used to be a lot more. Firstly I have been scammed THREE TIMES on Live blackjack where I have won the hand and then even though my connection is perfect I got disconnected and transferred over to their stupid automatic blackjack qhere it gives you your hand back and the dealers first card. I lose this nearly everytime this happens. I contact customer support stating what happened and even in one case screenshotted the hand I had just before it screwed me over. EVEN with this evidence I still never got my money back as Ladbrokes replied to me through mail asking me every question in the world when usually basic DPA is all I need. So yeah do NOT use their casino, all their bonuses take all of your money too and when you win you can never withdraw because of the ridiculous terms. Finally, I'm disgusted with the lack of bonuses I get from such a huge company. EVERY ONE of my other online companies give me free bets at least a couple of times a month, where as Ladbrokes have given me 1-2 off their own back. Its poor and to be honest I'm thinking of giving them up as I've given them this feedback before and they never deliver. I welcome any mails from Ladbrokes but I doubt I will ever get anything. My username is Danstacey95. Honestly people, a poor site which doesn't give cusomers an incentive at all to bet with them. Even their daily bonus thing is absolute crap and always requires you to deposit and is always part of the sly T's and C's.",1

When I checked with Customer Service I was advised that I had to wager another £792 before being allowed to withdraw anything and that the bets I waged could be no more than £6.  I couldn't even withdraw my own £20!!I thought I'll start putting £6 on black on roulette wheel and since the odds are nearly 50/50 should be OK for quite a few bets.

2016-11-11,"So....My mother opened an account 6 weeks ago and made several sizeable deposits with nothing said then one day when you to collect your winnings suddenly they want all kinds of ID when they've paid back via that deposit method before! Then then went on to continue to take deposits whilst her withdrawal was being held, is that not illegal? They are one of the scummiest companies we've had the unfortunate pleasure to deal with and it will never happen again.  The company is a shambles and they lie and cheat so they never have to pay back - also the account was never queried when winnings were still in pending so they win again.  If you are looking for an online bookie, please, I urge you not to open an account with these criminals!",1
2016-11-08,"Had an email from Ladbrokes offering me a free bet if one of the legs of my ACCA bet failed, it linked through to a page where it showed Win-Draw-Win and BTTS markets. Placed 6 bets, one lost, so I expected my £5 back as a free bet. When it didn't appear, I went onto Live Chat, where I discovered that only the Win-Draw-Win market is eligible for this offer, despite the promotional email having linked through the the BTTS score list of games as well. Of course it's in the T&Cs, so my argument that it was misleading and request to refund my £5 a gesture of goodwill was (not very politely) refused. I was told I could email Ladbrokes to complain, so I did, and had no reply. Two weeks later, I went onto Live Chat again and was told they had replied - strange how I receive so many marketing emails from them but that particular email got lost. But in any case, they still refused me a £5 free bet. So I've withdrawn my remaining funds and closed my account. I have several other online betting accounts and Ladbrokes isn't one of the better ones - this isn't the first time I've had issues with them and looking at the reviews here, I'm not the only one. Sad and perhaps rather short-sighted, given the competition, that they would rather lose a customer than give a one off £5 free bet as a gesture of goodwill. But it's their loss.",1

2016-11-03,"Me and my boyfriend both use our Ladbrokes account he likes the football betting and I like playing the slots, that was until what happened last night we are going to open up an account with a PROPER company! So my boyfriend has a four game bet going on the football, three games have won and the last game has about 20 mins left, anyway the last game goes 2 nil up and it offers him a cashout for 168 pounds, the bet was worth 183 so he thought 168 pounds will do nicely so he tried cashing out and it kept saying suspended even though when he clicked on in play football it wasn't suspended in any way so as the time went on the offer started dropping and the same thing over and over betting suspended even though there was no suspended odds on the in play he kept trying and trying to cash out but it wouldn't let him and unbelievably the team scored 2 goals in a minute and the game finished 2-2 so he lost, so after effing and blinding to customer services they just waffled a load of rubbish and said if it was suspended then he couldn't cash out even though it wasn't suspended he just slammed the phone down, anyway after this I deposited 60 pounds to have a go on my slots and after the game took 53 Pounds without a win I finally got the free spins feature! UNBELEIVABLY I was 27 spins into 30 free spins and my total winnings was 136 pounds the game crashed! After frantically going back into the game my game vanished along with my winnings!!! I rang customer service in tears and was basically told in as many words that someone would look into it eventually!! I phoned again this morning and the man said there was nothing on my account  regarding the slot malfunction, so they quite literally stole off the pair of us :( we both work very hard and to be treated like this is discusting, my dad says I should report them to the company who investigates bookies wrong doings and I'm that upset I think I will.

The distinction between what is 'Ladbrokes' and the 'Advertiser' WITHIN the Ladbrokes site - after logging on, is VERY, VERY poor to put it kindly.The end result is that the wagering time limit is not the 30 days listed within the Ladbrokes T & C's but can be only 7 days.It may be legal but it stinks of sharp practice and does the Ladbrokes reputation no good at all.THE FOLLOWING IS THE REPLY RECEIVED FROM LADBROKES - 16/10/16 - REGARDING EMBEDDED ADVERTISERS.""Please be informed that the advertiser will be based on the page where you created your account.

2016-09-28,"So I went in to ladbrokes in Milton Keynes to have a little flutter. I have never had a problem with them before but after today I do not want to go back again until the staff learn how to be polite and nice to customers who could go elsewhere.I went and couldn't remember if the door needed to be pushed or pulled to open. So at first I pulled it, realised it was wrong so I pushed it open and went in. The guy behind the desk then decided to have a go at me for being too forceful and threatening me if I broke 'his door' again. I attempted to apologise and explain what I had done but he continued to be patronising and rude to me.I then moved over towards the machines and the member of staff then starts slagging me off, using the f word pretty much saying how stupid I am. Not what you expect to happen when you go into a bookies especially as there are so many about now! I am very annoyed about this as this was not really a major issue and to be spoken to in the way the member of staff spoke to me was very insulting as you'd think a member of staff whose aim is to deliver good customer service would be a bit more professional! Also, it's not like it's the end of the world is it! I didn't break the door and there are more important things in the world to be worrying about! When there are lots of competitor bookies in the central Milton Keynes area such as coral, betfred and jenningsbet, you'd think that you as a customer are seen as valuable and that the workers want you to return by being friendly. Well obviously not at ladbrokes and if the guy is going to be like that with everyone who opens the door 'wrong', he won't have many people in! Won't be returning to this disgrace!",1
2016-09-28,"Was given a casino bonus of £15 after depositing £100.As per many of the bookmaker promotions, I met the wagering requirements and managed to get to a grand total to £2550.Obviously I was very pleased!Went to withdraw the funds, however I had apparently breached the T&C's (that we never sent to me). According to the terms I was not permitted to place a bet of £4.50 or higher (30% of bonus), on each game, which is ridiculous, especially when the minimum bet is £1.Anyway, spent the whole day chasing it, only to find out that they have indeed cancelled the winnings in my account and left me with my original £100 in my account.More than happy to take the money when the customer loses.Anyone know if you can get legal assistance on this? Surely this has to be regulated?",1

2016-09-23,"While having a short break in Carmathen I visited Ladbrokes 1st I was not greeted by Andrew as I gave him tickets to check not a word was spoke to me as he gave me the money why you say because he was engaged in a very fowl mouth language phone call, the words Bas***d and Fu**ing were among the very un professional conduct even after the phone was put down not a sorry please or thank you. Cannot believe in this treatment when I returned home our regular Ladbrokes assistant said to report this as it looks bad on all the staff",1
2016-09-21,I wagered over 10 minutes 110 quid on a slot in a shop and just sat and watched nothing happen. The biggest win was 2 quid. I asked after what the odds were and got a funny blank look from over the counter. The bonus was non existent. Its meant to be a fun experience.  Stay with betfred. stay clear of ladbrokes from now on and in the future.,1
2016-09-18,Do not use ladbrokes placed a five fold for 5 pounds on there website and it placed 25 pound instead of 5 they know this as there website put my fold as a four fold in error instead of it being a five fold i contacted support and they would not refund my bet even though i did not even place 25 pound i asked why there was no cash out as i checked all games and they was offering cash out on all games! But they tell me i can not get a cash out! i think they perposly made my bet place 25 pounds instead of 5 pounds so i lost my money do not use this company!!!,1
2016-09-17,I got chatting to a fella called David who was extremely helpful and patient especially as he was chatting to a complete idiot with this kind of thing.All my problems are now solved.Thanks,5

2016-09-08,"Rarely reply to email correspondence. Agents refuse to allow you escalate complaints, even the CEOs office does not respond. I will be having to take my complaint up with the regulatory offices as Ladbrokes do not offer customers any service.",1
2016-09-02,Wow! Reading through the reviews seems I'm not the only one who's been robbed by these thieves! I wagered £420 in four days on there slots on the same game and the biggest reel win it gave me was £9 and I got the feature bonus probably 5 - 6 times in that £420 and the best win it gave me was £4.85!! Complete and utter daylight robbery!! I recorded my plays and sent them to the gambling commission who emailed me back saying how appalling it was and that they are going to contact Ladbrokes about it. I urge people STAY CLEAR of their slots they are rigged to rob you!! Also if you've had similar experiences to me email the gambling commission! Maybe then they won't get away with what theyre doing to their punters!!,1
2016-08-31,Instructions very unclear and the help chat just ignores me. I signed on for £50 free bet got a 5r worth somehow. Got an email saying I have £5 free on a on play game so I did that and it charged out of my own money and refused to let me cash out wut da f@#k,1
2016-08-31,Great first time experience! Payed out straight away without problems will defo use for ggs again 😊,4
2016-08-31,"Wish I'd come onto Trust pilot before signing up to Ladbrokes Casino! What a joke! All of the recent feedback makes me see that I'd have been better off if I'd taken money out my bank and used it as toilet paper! I would've gotten better use from it! So I got to the slots and the thing is stuck, so when I swipe it NOTHING happens, but I get charged £25 for that turn! So naturally I contact their customer services as you would when you get a bum deal! But I'm told rather aggressively that it did in fact work and of course my eyes must be deceiving me as it must've spun because that's what their computer says!Oh ok, so my eyes are faulty, maybe I should go to my Dr...what a bunch of muppets and morons! I've told them how bad the ir service is and told them not to bother replying, yet in my inbox sits another stupid reply about how wrong I am! No problem Cr*pbrokes...ill be sticking with Paddy Power in the future! Not only do they not have glitchy technology, but their customer service is helpful, friendly and non aggressive! Do not qaste your money on these pirates! They also have fake stories circulating in the media about how much people have won from their casino! Oooh, you could be flipping burgers today and rich tomorrow! Well maybe, but not from these ingrates! Play at own risk!",1
2016-08-30,"Many verification steps that are excruciatingly long to complete, most matches I bet on gets ""partially rejected"" and the remaining cash I deposit is stuck on the account. Very very bad website compared to other bookies. 1/10",1

I sent them repeated times and different versions of ID each time they told me they couldn't verify its authenticity, resulting in my account being blocked. So after days of going round in circles I am unable to collect my winnings or get refunded for my origional deposit! Absolutely shocking service and customer service is no better. My advice is to stay well clear of Ladbrokes!",1
2016-08-21,Made a bet of 0.62p and it came up as £62! Rang them up straight away but I was on hold for 20 mins and then the bet had finished and I had lost anyway. Wouldn't refund and customer service was awful. Would not recommend. Bet 365 are your best for online bets. Have 2 kids that saw me crying because of it.,1
2016-08-16,I started recently on Ladbrokes as a new player and had a nice first deposit bonus.I was able to play all trough the wager (two full days of playing) but when i almost finished the wager the system turned around and did eat almost everything.Did go from almost 1000 euro to 0 euro and after deposited another 200 euro only to see it being lost within a hour.Since it not felt right i was looking for any other oddities besides the extreme below avarage returns and to my amazement i saw my spins were directly added to the jackpot system.Even made videos from it happening and did send my feedback including the video's to the support team.After 2 weeks of investigation they claim it was just a bad streak of luck and they say everything looks normal in my logs.I really sure the system had a error but they deny this.It took really a lot of effort to get them to answer and it is really sad to see they not putted up a real investigation but just took a look at my logs from my account.There was nothing strange to see and there is also no information on what is going on in the system itself.I will never play this casino again until they really look into my case and come with a fair solution in this matter.Gave up hope so far and until today they still have my account frozen because of security reasons.Says enough i guess.,1
2016-08-11,"Just spoken to the online chat. Very helpful, even though I was a bit stupid in needing to contact them in the first place. Ah well, all's good now. Brilliant company.",5
2016-08-11,I am a regular customer in the holborn branch. Recently they appoint a new guy there. His name is dami. He is very slow and lazy at his job. Looks like he doesn't have any interest and he have no idea what he is doing.Every time I go with the betting slip to check he always ask me if that is a winner and loser????That is ridiculous .I think that is his job to check if it's winner or loser. He said me that I always bring the losing slip to check. For God sake it doesn't matter If i bring the winning slip or loosing slip just check in your system. Zero customer service and no manner at all,1
2016-08-11,Never in my life have i experienced such a poor lay out on this site and constantly crashes I would never stake another penny on this site absolute junk that's without the terrible payouts would give zero stars if possible,1
2016-08-09,Poor bonus rounds on slots. There are much better sites. Never had a big win in years despite being a regular depositer.,1
2016-08-09,"Website promises all manner of wonderful promotions, such as 'money back if second' on televised races: but if you take advantage of these your account will very quickly be restricted. Most bookies will restrict or close your account if you win regularly or target their free bet offers, but Ladbrokes do this faster than anyone else. It took them only a few month to restrict my account - this after I'd won just a few hundred pounds. Subsequently when I tried to put a bet on it was 'referred to a trader' and my stake restricted. The limits were so small - on one occasion I was restricted to 2.50p on a 1-5 shot, ie restricted to winning 50p - I gave up altogether. A bad joke of a bookmaker, don't even bother to open an account with them.",1
2016-08-07,"I had been with Ladbrokes for over a year and although I don't gamble much I did like their odds and promotions.I went to use my in-play free bet today and was told that my account has been restricted by the ""trading team"".When I asked why as my account has given them hundreds the only reason was it was a ""trading decision""???A trading decision to not except money from a losing punter???I am very confused and as a result of my stakes being a max of £0.50 I told them where to go.To email me, bet £20 in-play to receive £10 and not pay out is criminal.I would suggest Bet365, Betfair or Smarkets not thes jokes!",1

2016-08-04,Of all the poker sites Ladbrokes is by far the best customer service the layout of the site is simple and this is the only site I feel I can trust due to the the many high street outlets it almost feels local  . Probably not the busiest site but I feel this is a big advantage far less (big players winning everything ) All in all far better playing experience than all the other sites and trustworthy,5

2016-08-02,A few months ago I had a problem receiving a bonus I was entitled to so i contacted Ladbrokes VIP team who informed me that this matter had to be looked into. After a week of numerous phone calls and pestering I finally got told that apparently i had opened another 40+ accounts and claimed bonuses on all of the accounts. Now to my knowledge I have only ever  had 2 accounts with Ladbrokes one i opened and forgot the details for and the one I have now which I have had for nearly 4 years. Due to these so called 40+ accounts I was informed that my account is now blocked from receiveing any kind of deposit or promotional bonuses I am absolutely outraged I wasnt even given a chance to explain or to give my side of the story they just made the decision with absolutely no input from myself and they have decided this decision is final and will never be overturned. Which is why i no long deposit on site and once my free bingo allowance is gone I will be closing my account and saying good riddance!!,1
2016-08-02,"I have gambled with this company for well over twenty years and finally had a significant win of approx 5k, the money was showing in my account but no payment, despite speaking to numerous members of staff who advised me my bet was fine and would be paid it wasn't. I placed my bet in good faith but apparently didn't meet their t&c's. The money was swiftly removed from my account and they paid me my £100 stake back, I genuinely feel they have cheated me, they say I clicked on a bonus, now if anybody has dealt with ladbrokes you will know you are inundated with pop ups etc..What's the saying 'that's how they get you' this is a complete con and I plead with you not to use Ladbrokes, they have poor customer service staff and absolutely no loyalty to their long standing customers. If this post stops just a handful of people using their site then I'll be happy they will have lost more than my return.",1
2016-07-26,"I made 2 deposits into my ladbrokes casino account of £35 and for this got 2 x £10 bonus amounts. I then started playing the slots and amazingly got my account up to £600+ (i never dipped below £80 in account so didn't use bonus amount). I then contacted the online chat to see when I could withdraw and after the agent looked into my account was told I needed to get to £1500+. Well would you believe it I got there and was able to withdraw my winnings........ or so I thought.2 days later I get a call to say that as I had made bets from £2 up to £10 a go so I had broken ladbrokes rules on deposit bonuses where you can't bet over 30% of your bonus amount in 1 go and my money was cancelled.The fact that I won straight off meaning I didn't use the bonus amount didn't matter. The fact that there was no warning that I was betting too high didn't matter. The fact that the person on the online chat who looked into my account didn't say anything didn't matter. I just got a response of ""well if you had bothered to read the T&C you would of seen you broke the rules"" as a response. I advise everyone to never to use Ladbroke 's site. Never accept a bonus! Your original stake becomes worthless as soon as you do.Made a complaint against them with The Independent Betting Adjudication Service (IBAS) and waiting on a response!",1

After expressing my sheer disgusted the cheeky s*** had the cheek to say he would credit my account with a £5 bonus as a gesture of goodwill £5!!!!!! Told him to ram it and reported Ladbrokes.com to trading standards and the gambling commission, please avoid this site they are dreadful in every way!!!!",1

2016-07-11,I couldn't  sign up online as they claimed that my passport photo wasn't visible enough.

I bet €10 which they took whilst my application was on hold. Then they refused my application and cashed in the money.,2

As a test, i got a mate to deposit £10 to his account and then withdraw, needless to say he got his money within 6 hours and yet i'm still waiting for mine.  Nice to see Ladbrokes keeping to a responsible gambling system and not just trying to hold on to people's winnings in the hope they reverse the withdrawal....Oh hang on, thats just what they do.  Terrible company and i'll be shutting down my account once this payment has come in and sticking with PaddyPower (who don't let you reverse withdrawals and process them within 4 hours 99.5% of the time).Just an update on this, i canceled the withdrawal of £200 at 10am and split it up into 4 £50 withdrawals and shock horror, all was paid into my PayPal just after 6 hours.

2016-06-22,"Been with Ladbrokes for a long time, and they are as good as any in the market.  I don't get others' issues with slots, games, etc as these are mostly syndicated anyway on shared platforms so not just unique to ladbrokes.I do find Ladbrokes sports betting odds a little skinnier than elsewhere, and the lack of a cash out feature is a little behind the times, but the main plus is the customer service - they aren't always able to sort things out the way you would like but they are helpful and available 24/7 through live chat, and the VIP team can be highly recommended - I spoke to Joe this morning for example, and although the issue wasn't sorted out in my favour [which is fine], he was totally fair and helpful as their staff always are.The free spins and bonuses etc are pretty worthless - but that's the case right across the sector, so you can't blame them for that.Thoroughly recommend Ladbrokes to anyone.",5

For my £235 I got the FREE SPINS bonus ONCE!! And it paid me £7.60!!! £7.60 winnings from staking £235 is discusting!!! That isn't gambling that is just rigged to bleed people dry!!!

Got nowhere near the 20 x wagering requirements on the bonuses but lost money so was ok with that too.  What i didn't know and was never told, is that once you take one of these bonuses then ALL FUTURE DEPOSITS will be linked to it (not just the original deposit to which the bonuses are allocated) this means if you ever win anything they do not have to pay out as they say you still need to reach the wagering requirements of the first bonus.Online help if you can ever get hold of them are condesending and anything but helpful.  Eventually got bonuses removed but still cannot get my money back due to Internal errors in their system, weirdly these errors do not stop you making deposits, just withdrawals.",1
2016-06-04,"Common problems sorted in chat, with a real person. Anyone who plays games knows what the really annoying issues are. 1) eg... Got a feature like 15 free spins on a game, on a winner... Game freezes. (all sites are affected by this sort of internet network issue)Ladbrokes have great (what I call) error detection. 99.9% of the time the game will reload and resume from where it left off. Only once has that not happened for me, on a new game, that was quickly removed and fixed once I told the staff in chat. Also was sorted out on the payout.2) account issue arises, need to communicate.Click the chat box, instantly get a person on the case. None of this stupid email customer services, get a ticket and wait a week. The people who you chat with can fix 99.99% of the issues you give them. 100% for me, but I'm sure there is one impossible issue out there.Overall, online, it's one of the best places for a customer. If not the best. The games selection is also impressive. A wide selection from lots of different manufacturers. Unlike a lot of sites that seem to be locked into one or two brands.FFS, I deserve a £50 bonus for this review. Seriously though, if you're into casino/games/vegas slots, it's hard to beat. Only way it could get better is, of course, more games. Those new CR games are pretty good. The 100% complete netEnt collection would be good too.",5

I therefore closed my account.  In fairness, I suspect that punters who are dissatisfied are likely to complain and those who are pleased with the service don't bother to give a review.

So I have the right to comment. Seriously your software is rubbish and must only be played by the addicted. Dealer shows picture card nearly every deal gets 21 through the most exaggerated card sequences.

2016-04-24,"Quite simply, they should be investigated by the gambling commission for fraud and false advertisement * the free bets I was offered were as clear as day and even a code being used for it. There was no doubt that I received the offer but then told that I didn't meet the requirements. Absolute nonsense, the offer was as clear as day, and having a backround in law and reading all of their terms, they clearly stated after new sign up any wager of this minimum amount on any sportsbook bet would give me the free bets in pounds. So after being told ""of course sir, your free bets will be available within 24 hours"" and then eventually, that I didn't qualify for the free bets, I can say with certainty that they scammed me. Good luck to Ladbrokes and other thieves like them when, inevitably legislation is enacted to make a level playing field, and god forbid they have to actually earn their profits and success and have good customer service.

A real pain to use. Tip : if you want people's money then make the site presentable & easy to use ! instead of flaky & looking like it was done on the cheap. Why log out customers when they are logged in ? they might be just about to make a deposit then not bother if they have to keep logging in again.Odds : have a look at oddschecker.com - very rarely are Ladbrokes best priced or joint best priced on anything ! Really poor value. Very quick to restrict sports bets to silly amounts like £1 or £2 stake, but you can still stake huge amounts per spin on their childish low payout slot games. Shows that they don't want their customers to win anything. And their exchange charges a base rate of 5% commission ! you can pay just 2% or 1% on other exchanges these days, like smarkets & matchbook. At least they have improved their withdrawal processing times, but the overall feel is of a flaky, poor value, mean gaming site.",1

2016-03-28,"Firstly the gambling experience is great in shop and online, especially online. Also, I suffer disabilities and am a working business woman at the same time- others with similar illness' are not so fortunate. On being upfront with Ladbrokes they help me all the way- if I cannot get to the shop VIP find a way around it. They know I work hard play hard, However, before they knew that of me they were on the RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING checks looking out for me, a disabled woman and ensuring I would not be in a position to spend any more than I could afford to loose. Furthermore I generally win, best wins I've had from any book makers and I am VIP Casino/gaming in the main with some sports and slots- daily offers, daily support from VIP team who are Outstanding. For me when I want to play hard I hit up my friends at VIP as if I were sat in Las Vegas kickin' it with my buddies, I ask for guidance or help they are there every time, a link when I can't be bothered to find a game, free IT advice (I work on iMacs and game on PC which isn't my strong suit but it's an escape from work) my VIP team friends send me instructions if I want for quick keys, clear cache anything I do not know how to do using microsft or PC they instruct me clearly, preceisely and for free. When you have intermittend serious mobility issues I cannot tell you how nice iit is, from comfort of my home resting, to be transported to the play table with my own VIP crew who fetch and carry for me delivering every time, and I sit there winning and wining. It is gambling, I take losses everyone does, it you aren't up for that do not play- simple. However if you choose to play, can afford it Ladbrokes look after their customers. Other companies all display the responible gaming and customer protection stuff, it's in legal it's on site and in shop. However I have been a gambler since my Father taught me three decades ago, been to every book maker there is, experienced them all. ONLY Ladbrokes have exhibited such ethics in the Real world by always checking and checking again thatv I am safe, in control, and sufficiently solvent in accordance with their customer protection. There is only one casino/sports book/multi platform place I can acuse truthfully of having shown concern and care for customers and really, politely and unobtrusively adhered to responsible gaming and customer care ETHICS-Ladbrokes.Biggest wins, best bonuses- the others look good in reality the small print will drop your big win to nothing elsewhere, I stride in to Ladbrokes VIP to make large withdrawals won fair and square with help from my friends at VIP Live and call centre. It takes far less investment/gambling to reach VIP status than elsewhere. And, never thought I'd utter this, they are an ethically sound casino! Beat that. Thank you Ladbrokes. No offers or enticements attract me next to what I know I get from my friends at VIP- Transported to play time wherever I want to be in my imagination with non stop service and help so my playtime does not involve site navigation, nor admin, none of the stuff I do on a work computer- they do it all for me knowing I am only there to play.",5

2015-12-14,Ladbrokes.com look for all excuses they can to not payout your winnings. I opened my account in September and as I quickly made over 500 pounds worth of winnings. However whenever I tried to withdraw it they asked for ID. I have sent them 50 different images of my identity. As they kept declining me I begged for help as to what I was doing wrong. Staff refused to help me. The only feedback I got was change background and it is unclear. I was taking these photos with a Samsung Galaxy s6. When I raised a complaint that no one would explain what was wrong. They closed my account and took back all my winnings based on the fact that they were unable to read my date of birth off the 50 plus images of my driving license and passport. Worst con artists ever. Robbed me of over 520 pounds worth of winnings,1
2015-12-13,"OUTRAGEOUS BONUS BET TURNOVER, DON'T BE FOOLED!!I had signed up and deposited $50 to receive $150 in free bets, but unfortunately with all that extra money it's still a little hard to win when you have to TURNOVER ALL YOUR WINNINGS 2X AND ALL YOUR BETTING STAKE 2 X. After speaking to the customer service guy who was mind you quite patient explaining things, here's what the requirements are: The initial deposit needs to be TURNED OVER ONCE ($50).  That's fine, BUT you cannot withdraw unless you satisfy ALL OTHER turnover requirements, which are:- Your $150 free bets 2x TURNOVER- ANY winnings 2x TURNOVER EXAMPLE:Say you spend the whole $150 on a 3.00 stake and you win, you get back $450 - $150 (initial stake taken out) = $300 in your account.  You now have to TURNOVER 2X those winnnings, which is $600.  Besides that, you now have to TURNOVER your stake 2X, which is $300. So for betting $150 in bonus bets and winning a 3.00 stake/bet, you now have to TURNOVER a WHOPPING $900 to EVEN BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW a cent!  WHAT A RIP OFF! A lot of OTHER BOOKIE'S require a turnover of ONLY the winnings ONCE, and your initial deposit ONCE, that's it.

On Ladbrokes they seem to treat any withdrawal as an affront, drag their heels about processing the withdrawal, leaving it as a ' pending balance ' for at least two days (!) in the hope that the customer will reverse the withdrawal during those two days then lose it, so they don't have to pay out. How does this fit in with their avowed ' responsible gambling ' policy ? - rubbish promotions such as 3 free spins if you spend £50 on their low-payout slots. Wowee ! How can they still be in business with such generosity ?! - poor, low value odds on their sportsbook. Very rarely are Ladbrokes best-priced or even joint best-priced about anything on oddschecker. If you're looking for value, then look elsewhere .  - buggy website often slow to load with - get this - cartoon characters on what is supposed to be a gambling site for adults ?! how does that work ?!  - poor unhelpful customer service, and quick to restrict customers, e.g. max £10 bet on a horse . £10 ?! Oh but you can stake ridiculous amounts per spin on their dumb cartoony slots, where they can control the outcome. - their poker site is part of the notorious ipoker network .

2015-10-03,"After excluded myself many years ago, I decided to pop in to a local branch, whilst in side the branch none of the staff questioned me i.e ID and so forth. I assumed my exclusion had expired and continued to visit another branch at a locally at a later date.   I recently tried to open an online account and was told I self excluded myself at a branch many years ago and that I was still in exclusion period. I then emailed customer services to explain that I was in two of their shops recently and they had two opportunities to carry out cheeks ( I must add that in one shop, I knew a staff member who acknowledged me too). Customer told me that the onus me, but I didn't have the form to hand after many years absent to check there and then, thinking that I would be flagged or checked on their system... Never happend.   I told them also that any other businesses who provided a self exclusion or barring facilities would carry checks regularly cause I.e lets just say for example I walked in to a local Ladbrokes branch and did something like smashed a machine or heaven forbid punched someone and it later came to light that I was excluded and shouldn't have been there in the first place. I thought that the whole point of providing a self exclusion service was to prevent customer form visiting branches and if they can instantly flag it up online, why can't they do the same in branches, it's not as if I wasn't there for a second, more like over 30 minutes to carry out checks.  Customer services one moment stated in an email correspondent I was only excluded at one branch and not others, but when I challenged them on this matter, they quickly told me it applied to up to five shops. How can it go form one shop to five shops in an instant?  My whole point is why provided a service if Ladbrokes failed to implimented it properly and whilst I acknowledged some failings on my part but the expression comes to mind, it takes two to tango.Never going to use this company ever going from their lack of carrying out procedures they provided.",1

The funny thing is that the horse won, my 10 euros became 670 euros and of course I went to withdraw the money.  I made the withdraw request on Friday and on Monday I got a e-mail that said I had to send a copy of my ID and a proof of address. So I made a copy of my drivers license and wrote on it that it was a copy for Ladbrokes. The next day I got a response email saying that my ID was not accepted as valid, because I wrote on it and some details were covered. While all the needed details were still visible. My proof of address was also not accepted. It was a Bank statement pdf downloaded from my bank website. Now I have send a new copy of my ID and proof of address, but instead of responding in 24 hours it's taking a while longer. Customer service said that a signed letter from my bank would be a valid proof of adress and that it could take up to 72 hours. I'm still waiting to see how everything turns out. But long story short. It can take a while when you're new before you can withdraw money.",3

2015-07-01,"Well when I first joined I clicked on the link for the bonus - nothing came through - I queried this and just got back it was too late to sort out. I was out of time. The follow up bonus was awarded through a chat when I was querying it and the initial problems.I'd credited my money to the wrong part to get the bonus - I am not a psychic and thought I was just crediting labrokes. Its an odd set up with different parts.I clicked on the online chat and was told I needed to chat to someone in Casino - how could I do that... I'd clicked where the chat button was.But that issue was with free spins which sorted itself out,Today again I find that yesterday I'd clicked on an email link - it gave no codes and took me straight to the cashier where £15 was already selected..so I played. I later topped up by £12.No bonus appeared and in chat to day I was advised again that was a matter for casino but if I wanted to deposit more today I'd get some free spins.This is just not good enough - you are a big company",2

I cannot help but feel that Ladbrokes do not want me to use the Free/Promotional bets that I have “earned”. That said, I went online today and todays issue was addressed very quickly by Debbie on the Live Chat. The rating I am giving here is related to this service and not the overall Ladbrokes online betting experience.",4

2015-06-05,Quick. Simple and very polite ☺,5
2015-06-02,BEWARE!!!! I started winning on ladbrokes promotional markets. Example: every weekend i would place $20 bets on boosted odds favourites which would give me a return of $40. After 3 weeks of winning i have been blocked from ALL promotions. No other bookmaker has done this to me and believe they should state upon opening account: warning win too much and we will stop you winning!!,1

2015-05-06,"ive been a member of alot of betting sites such as coral, william hill,paddy power, betfred and so on, i dont really care for there customer service as its rare you need to talk to them on a betting site anyway but ladbrokes customer service is terrible. they are no help what so ever and are lazy and blunt. Anyway almost every site gives you a welcome promotion or more than one, ladbrokes gives you nothing apart from one bet even though you get like 3 on every other site. the poker is the worst ive ever seen i have won alot on other sites but on ladbrokes i couldnt win a hand. there poker tokens are dreadful, even on coral which i hate they give you a lot more than this tight company. i didnt bother with the casino which is probably a first for me. the only game i went on was rainbow riches and all i seem to be winning was 5p and then i was down to 12p so i lowered my lines just to get rid of the money and the first time out of over a 100 spins i hit the 3 leprechauns and won £1.36. usually there is something good about a betting site such as paddy power were they love giving new people promotions or coral with there £20 bet and poker tokens and so on but there is nothing at all good about this site.i felt the need to warn fellow gamblers of this disfraceful site.",1
2015-05-06,"I made a withdrawal from ladbrokes today through paypal. I also made withdrawals from 3 other bookmakers,  Paddy power, Skybet and Stan James. Apart from ladbrokes the transfer took less than an hour, with paddy power being the quickest at less than 30 min ! I contacted ladbrokes live chat and was answered very quickly by a very pleasant and helpful lady called Sarah. She answered my questions promptly and pleasantly and although hearing that my withdrawal could take up to 48 hours to clear into my paypal account which I was a bit surprised and disappointed with, Sarah made the experience of contacting ladbrokes on live chat a pleasant experience and I would have no problem recommending their live chat service, just a pity their withdrawal service is not as quick as their competitors,  although I have been assured it is something they are working on.",3

2015-05-03,"I joined ladbrokes a very long time ago, I have seen the website adapt and change a few times, all to benefit the user. It is now mobile/tablet friendly this makes it easier to continue my experience when im away. If ever I have had a query, it was answered within minutes of speaking to the customer care team on chat. I do, however, think that how promotions work on the website is a little confusing. I.e for one promotion I had to enter the code on the account settings free bets section. For gaming (Bingo) I had to enter the promo on the Bingo hall (this was a little frustrating as there was no explanation of where to put the code) - Luckily there is always someone available to chat to on the help section or even on the chat rooms in bingo, this person was able to explain to me where to put the code. I am always kept updated with special promotions and events i.e. easter, birthday st patricks which are alluring. I will be continue to use ladbrokes and hope others use it too. Regards",5
2015-05-03,"Even after my mistake Ladbrokes honoured the promotion I thought II was entitled to. My initial advisor Kimberley, was very helpful and the second advisor (after the event I bet on), Matthew, was great, added the promo bonus to my account with no problems.

2015-04-20,Quick and helpful response from Vikki (Victoria) on the chat service regarding a missing deposit payment. She was very patient and I soon realised that the problem was due to an error on my part. I will certainly use this service again..,5
2015-04-20,I won £30 on Grand National weekend but it has proved very difficult to get access to my funds. I've had to send proof of address and after nearly a week the money still hasn't arrived. This review is not about that as such but the people I've dealt with. Chantelle (I think) as well as Daniel and Charlene were all very polite and did the best they could but it sounds as if Ladbrokes have a very clunky system relying on email with no indication of response or resolution times. I couldn't give the staff a poor rating as they did fine but Ladbrokes service itself is underwhelming to say the least. Personally I think they want the money to stay within their accounts so it's used up on future bets - it's certainly far easier to deposit money than get it back.,3
2015-04-20,"Struggling to withdraw my funds i 'spoke' to Charlene who helped me with immediate success! Nice and easy and quick, many thanks",5

We've asked for an investigation to be carried out. But it seems to be our word against Ladbroke. They won't pay out. It's in-excusable. I told,customer service to try it for themselves.

This email was covered with pictures of the national and it even advised me to ""saddle up"".The link on the email was not working so I logged onto my app and paid my tenner. No sign of my bonus so I phoned and spoke to the chap who told me it was a mistake and the bonus was for the casino. I asked why were the pics of horses and why would I need to saddle up to play cards, he told me he had nothing to do with the design of the email.Big company with small minded sneaky ways , best avoided.",1

2015-04-10,"I opened an online acct to place a bet on the grand national. I then received an email saying that as you couldn't verify me so I had restrictions on my acct including making withdrawals. So you can take my money without verification but can't give it back??I spoke to Sophie one of your chat people and she was polite. She has explained I need to go to one of your shops with photo ID and the restrictions will be lifted. I may as well have just placed my bets in the shop and not wasted my time filling out the info you requested. Sophie has also explained, once I've shown my ID if I have any winnings I can collect them from the shop. So I guess some things are still easier in person & should I wish to place any more bets in the future I will just go to a shop.",3

2015-04-10,"I recently spoke with 'Sports - Sarah' after I £1 bet was added to my Games account following a promotion. I cannot access Games and last week a representative confirmed this with me and adjusted my account to remove it from Games and add it to Sports. This was done in a matter of about 2 minutes and we had great banter along the way. Today, the same thing happened, but unfortunately I was connected to a robot who expressed less than zero desire to be helpful in this situation, sticking rigidly to a badly worded script and showing no signs of life, personality or service whatsoever. All of a sudden, and for absolutely no reason at all that she could explain, there is no way of transferring the token to sports, in spite of it being easily done a few days earlier. She then cut off our conversation and transferred me to someone in Games, who transferred me back to another chap in Sports. I then found out that the person I had spoken to last week was the manager who had only transferred the token as a gesture of goodwill. Fortunately, I kept the original conversation and can see that this was never mentioned at the time, I just assumed he was doing what he could to help a customer. Nothing was resolved and I ultimately gave up. The whole process took around 35 minutes and has completely put me off this service. As someone who spends good money with this company, she showed no customer appreciation or any helpful enthusiasm aside from getting me off her screen as quickly as possible. The lesson learnt? Only contact them during periods when they have internal promotions for customer service running and are trying to increase their positive reviews. Here is a quote from last week's conversation in which I was helped... ""So we've got a competition at work and the person who gets the most Trust Pilot reviews for the best Customer Service wins a prize....So if you could help me out that'd be fantastic!!! (Please mention you were speaking to Red Rum)   You can fill it in by clicking Here""",2

The only way to get rid of this is to click it, let it load, stop my current user journey on the website and then close the chat box.  Its pretty annoying and there is no fix apart from adding more money into my account, which is already full and doesnt require topping up.",2

2015-02-07,Depending on the browser you use Ladbrokes website is the problem.The staff are amazing always polite and ready to help its the websitethe clunky log in via IE often means 3/4 times before it happens the same changing from games/bets/etc. Also the payment system I don't understand why they don't simplify instead of selecting various sections of the site you want to deposit money. The win rate I cant fault and the games are Quality very little lag its just logging and using the account services really can be troubling.  *Update since I posted this Ladbrokes has been in touch a few times wanting more information on the issues and looking into it. Cant ask for more than that. :),4

2014-11-06,"Ladbrokes used to be a big name in the online gambling world, but of late they seem to be slipping up. Their website is tediously slow, to the point where I now refuse to play any of their slots and casino games. They do have a wide selection, but it is very slow. I run a brand new Macbook, top of the range, so it has nothing to do with my computer, and I haven't had these sort of issues elsewhere. It's a shame, as it was a very slick website at one point, but now it has the feel of an old PC with too many viruses...just too slow.",3

2014-09-20,It took me nearly 24 hours to get through to live chat as the system was down when I finally got through I spoke to a rep named Charlie who was polite and knowledgeable and sorted my problem out in quick time,5
2014-09-19,"I joined Ladbrokes 10 days ago and deposited £500. I made my bet and then I deposited another £160 to hedge the bet. At that point, I withdraw £660. The bet itself came through. However, I had an email from Ladbrokes saying that they needed to security clear me. This was fine but I was slightly annoyed that they took 2 days to request this after I requested the withdrawal. The most frustrating aspect of their email was the following line;  ""Moreover we need to have your explanation  about your withdrawal request without any gameplay."" They should know from their own systems that I have made my bets and even won from my bets. This is a fundamental flaw in their IT systems and very concerning. They then write in the email; ""If we can be of any further assistance, please contact us again and we will be happy to help you."" Therefore, I give them a call. The number I ring on states that the customer service number is different but I should call back later as they're busy. I follow their advice and call back later. I get connected to an agent called Josh, who transfers me to another number and they duly transfer me back to Customer Service. Ironically, Josh answers. I explain that whilst I understand the security clearance process and the need for it, they should have done this at the point of the deposit (1st or 2nd) as they were happy to take my money in nano-seconds but are less than prepared to return it. Josh interestingly states that 'Justin' who had signed the email to me ""doesn't work for Ladbrokes"". He then realises that this might not be correct and states that ""Justin does not work for Customer Services"". As you most probably can guess, Justin states to work for the Customer Service Team in the email. Maybe Ladbrokes need to security clear their own staff. Josh in fact could be Justin.....!?! I then find out that the Security Team is based in the Philippines and are not customer facing. So they want me to scan and send my passport and card details out of the EU and not even talk to someone regarding this. I ask for turnaround times and Josh states that he won't make the mistake of lying to me because he doesn't know. I ask to escalate the matter and want to talk to the Complaints Team. Josh thinks and then realises that  Customer Service is the Complaints Team and writes that 'Customer is not very happy'. I then ask if a Manager is around.  This goes on and on and the Manager won't come to the phone and Josh won't give me his name. They are prepared to do nothing to retain me, change my perceptions and thus, whilst I will supply my details to get my money back, they have really shown that they don't care about new customers. They offer all types of promotions to get new customers in and then when you join, they don't even have the IT systems, processes to manage simple tasks. As a closing statement, I advised Josh that maybe they should have a banner on their website letting new Customers know that they can only deal with x new customers and that once this threshold is met, potential customers should go elsewhere as Ladbrokes cannot cope.",1

2014-09-09,"The new design as of today is very good. It looks much more modern than some of your competitors, and I specially like the score desing on the sportsbetting. I also for a very odd reason like the round shapes and the colour red and white together. Compared to the aweful red and green design you have had earlier this is top notch. If I have one thing to put my mind to it's that I can't changed the time, but thats not something to hold against you. Further more I would like to say that todays (september 9th) (and earlier support has been very good). They seem to know the answer to what I'm wondering about. Some of you have a great sense of humor combined with seriousness, which i really like. Keep up the good work Azzie and the rest.",5

Pathetic.",1

2014-05-16,It's constant bombardment with spam from Ladbrokes. They don't value your privacy despite what they say. Be careful of you primary email.,1
2014-05-14,Played on Ladbrokes for a while mostly the bingo area and sometimes slots! The ticket prices are expensive and your money doesn't last long....seems impossible to win on this site. Not bothering anymore. Same winners over and over. The deposit system may seem confusing to new players as there are certain categories to add money too. Changed from games to gaming recently. A good site with game selection but don't be prepared for a nice win.,2
2014-04-13,"They had a recent change recently, changed slot machines to a different platform, For some reason they have gone sh&t, customer service is terrible, hardly non speaking English from abroad, have not got a clue, Long time to wait, website is playing up, real slow, They need to get there act together quick,",2
2014-04-05,"Started using their website doing the UK 6 and 7 ball lotto games a few months ago.  Main problem I have is that their account info recall is crap. Can only identify indvidual single line game entries when I search my account so it takes fecking ages to id 8 line game card entries especially if i have done multiple perms.  Also, account balance does not update automatically so have to re boot webpage regularly, and also refuses occassionally to take bets and says it has id'd me as being ""out of the uk"", so I have to re boot again.  Now I am completely unable to check games history on my account even when I can navigate elsewhere at the same time on the other options. Sent email to complain and they have kindly sent me sweet feck all in reply.",1

2014-02-07,"Ladbrokes really need to shapen up their customerservice and sharpen their informations on their homepages that are NOT in English!!!They have ""special offers"" for you, but those offers are only valid in one or two of their 9 gaming rooms, and only valid on a few of games in the specific room! Where on their homepage does this state that you can ONLY use the special offer in that and this room?? NOT even their customerservice can seem to answer me that, and keep on writing me other crap instead.LADBROKES IS NOT THE PLACE TO BE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AND WIN CASH!!!!! KEEP AWAY FROM THEM NOW!",1
2014-01-13,"Poor customers service, Poor promotions and Very Poor payouts. Quite shocking actually. Will have one good win in six months of paying out a certain amount. Warning please avoid!",1
2013-08-15,"Customer services were of no help whatsoever and felt at times they were wasting my time on purpose. They also do not appear to understand any of their own terms and conditions posted on the site. With much better bookies like bet365 and paddypower, I see no reason why anyone should ever bother with this site. They will also do everything they can to take your money. For example, I was told if I deposited I would be able to withdraw some winnings . After doing that, I was then told that I would have to complete £450 worth of wagering, and after managing to remove these requirements myself, figured out I would never have been able to withdraw the winnings and they were just trying to get me to loose more money.Odds on everything are short aswell",1
2013-08-14,I have been with Ladbrokes for some time.  I can't say I have never had a problem but they are really getting their act together and the new site improvements are looking great. Much easier to use. Their customer services agents have always tried to sort out my questions and overall the agents are friendly and helpful.  I use the shops occasionally and I love the fact that I can take my winnings out of my account in cash.,5

2013-07-14,"I have been working in a casino for almost 7 years and understand how important of the customers services for the betting business. however, the experience of my husband and me had in 39 wardour street which is in the heart of the China town London was awful. Extremely, there is one ""Chinese looking guy"" (he denied he is Chinese even he was speaking Cantonese) whose name is ""Yunchoi"" had shown his tricky face. he is there suppose to help those Chinese customers whose English is poor,  in fact, he was cheating on my husband just because my husband's English not good. he told lies on customers without feeling any sham.  And also, the whole team there is the same, i have to say what kind of manager will lead what kind of team. We won't go to Ladbrokes again as this awful experience we've never forget. Please stay away Ladbrokes!!!!!!!",1

2012-11-20,I worked in a betting shop for 25 years and feel customer relations to be a very important aspect of the job. Myself and my husband have been loyal customers of Ladbrokes in cramlington over a number of years and have found 1 member of staff to be very helpful and pleasant! Such a shame that your company don't value your staff the way your customers do! We will be taking our custom elsewhere from now on.,2

You just can't get a win.I had one football bet that was looking good with a woman's team with was 5 nil 20 mins inSo I won a bet on that for the first time in years. Which was only 35 quid And they removed the game so I couldn't bet again on this one. Hahahaha. Jokers.The biggest thieves in the world. Don't bother guys.,1
2023-01-24,they deleted my super 6 account midway through season with no logical explanation  _ I was punished for reactivating an old account. Skybet took no responsibility for it. Not a massive deal but certainly irritating and the useless customer service I have had trying to resolve the issues deserves a one star review,1
2023-01-13,Absolutely disgraceful behaviour from you and your staff who you have told to ignore any complaints regarding so called “ flutter “ issues. You have suspended my account for no reason  You may be in court with my lawyer come May as my Accumulator comes to an end with it comes over 1K . You will not get my money as that is fraud.

I’ve closed the account and won’t be going back happy to take your money but not so forthcoming when the odds turn and they are losing.They had all my ID in the beginning so I had no issues withdrawing just winning it seems.,1
2023-01-18,"Not a bad broker in terms of customer service they are good.But their website design needs to improve a lot, for example to show the day by day events, otherwise, I take much time to search on today's or tomorrow's games, which is not helpful.Also, they seem to add some events to the betting market after they've started, which disables me from building a suitable acca.They also need to add more international markets into their bet, like other brokers do.One sad thing is that their payouts are low comparing to other brokers.",3

I would tell everyone to do this and would definitely think twice about using any of these sites because overall they are a pile of crap with terrible odds and returns but also they change their rules regularly and you can guarantee it is not to help the paying customers.

In three weeks of having the app I've prob spent over £400.....waste of money i know. In this time I've been on feature board between about 30-40 times.....with an average pay out of between £1.50 and £4.00. Yes its gambling, so there are no guarantees, but the whole idea of game us to get to a feature.....but with feature wins as low as £.70p what's the point!! from my experience their payouts to money ratio is less than 2%.  If you want proof I've taken screen shots of every feature to prove it. They also use King as possible jackpot which can spin in any time.....last time for me it gave me £3!!!TBH im not sure how SKY BET ever passed uk gambling control requirements for their slots. If you use it its just throwing money down drain, there is no fun here! If you load up £30 on 50p bets the average time for all your money to be gone is less than 3 minutes....Very very poor app.",1

Buick top jockey this season colin Keane top irish jockey this season and Paul nichols top trainer last season. Saying that one or more don't end until December. They have all ended. Sky are showing alot of incompetence. You should pay out,1
2022-11-26,They are scammers. They won’t pay you out for shot on target bets when it’s clearly a shot on target and they will hide behind a 3rd party stat company that is nothing to do with sky bet themselves. Save your money and bet with Williamhill,1

The customer service was just like don't worry you can remove it from your credit report, but that's not the point.

2022-12-12,Initially I thought it was a really good site. Then noticed that it crashed instead of giving me the bonus. Slots visibly change before your eyes. I raised the issue and was told that without times and evidence they were unable to assist. Blaming my device or internet. Also tried to withdraw money to which a message saying insufficient funds available and unable to withdraw. So left game the balance disappeared when I got to the home screen. Checked bank and nothing went in. Contacted cust service to be told it's Worldpay issue which they will refund automatically. No idea of timescale. To be told that slots are random generated numbers but yet you see it visibly skipping and altering so you don't receive bonuses all the time leads me to question the random element to the explanation. Seems heavily leaning towards players Not winning.,1
2022-09-16,I found to be a good fair company despite seeing others reviews.  Been using sky bet for a very long time and if you lose you lose and if you win you win always get money fast when withdrawal no problems ever unlike loads of other gambling sites have used!

They make the pricing as well as providing you with the information, and you try to win money from them? near on impossible. This is what happens when you leave a massive company governing themselfs without accountability, they are free to do as they wish. There's so much I know for a fact about this industry, but if I start to say everyone gonna thing that I am crazy. Best ways! Only spend what you can afford to lose.",1

Case still pending",1
2022-09-10,You will struggle to find a sports betting website that offer worse odds than Skybet. I just put a random accumulator together to compare. 19/1 on William Hill was 11/1 on Sky bet. They offer nothing to their customers of note. It’s almost impossible to find the chat (so they clearly don’t want people contacting them either) - Last resort website 100%,1

I asked for proof of this including log in times IP Address etc and they closed my account and stopped talking to me. Customer service ? what Customer Service you make a complaint and their attitude is go away and then close your account. I'm not the only one they have done this too read all the other reviews. They wont help you they just want your money then treat you like dirt. Absolute disgusting behaviour from a Multi million pound company.  Rip you off then then ban you .  What's worse is they just do not give a damm. Just look at how many replies they have made to negative feedback on here a grand total of Zero, that says it all in a nutshell.",1

He recently put his new card back on his account.He called to ask if he could get his account rewards back and the racist customer service staff suspended his account and blocked him from messaging them again. I have asked for a phone number the the bullying racists won't give him 1. He rarely leaves the house since he was attacked and ribbed. His only enjoyment is to have a bet on the football and listen yo it on the radio. Now the racist bully's have taken that away from him.,1

2022-07-06,Absolutely shocking from a greedy company. They don’t mind if your account is in losses for months and months. But as soon as I started gaining some money back and made £2000 profit over 2 months they restricted account and stopped all access to promotions.they were still willing to let me have unlimited deposits though. Stay away from this company!,1

You're get a 10p or 50p bonus and apparently its totally random. I've been with them for years and only received 50p bonuses and then they stick you in the game that get nothing back.

2022-07-29,Can I ask why when offering extra places on races that you already give 1/5 of the odds a place on in handicaps are you also 2 full points worse on the price than anyone else is that because you are not best odds on them so you know people have to have that price it’s just take take take make it look good with the extra places but take money back in other places,2

They were happy to accept around £3500 of deposits in this period of time.

I had placed a bet on 'money back of your horse is second' and in this case my horse did come second but no refund. I had to contact them to find out why and apparently these has been an exclusion places on my account that I wasn't aware of as they had not informed me.. they now say that the money will not be refunded and without promotions there is absolutely no reason why anyone should use these cowboys. I cannot think of a reason why I should be excluded bar the fact that I'm up over 400 quid for the year in profit and they maybe don't like that.

On the casino/slots side I am £2800 down, so overall they have made £1000 from me in 12 months, not a great amount but still profit for Sky. So what does the nice bookmaker do, they ban me from all promotions and restrict my stakes on all bets on all sports but allow me to have promotions on the casino side!

Because you as a punter don't offer so much value to them! They don't like winners they only want losers and the gambling commission really should clamp down on these rogues!!!

When I used chat to enquire I was directed towards their security team. I rang them and was on hold for 20 mins and then a curmudgeonly fellow from the North East explained it was due to my depositing cash and withdrawing some of it without betting.This chap really was on a power trip, a wannabe policeman presumably bitter because he’s working nights for a betting company feeding off human misery.He asked me why I thought my account was suspended before rattling off some transactions where I’d deposited and withdrawn, using the word fraud. I asked him who I’d defrauded if the money was coming out of and back into the same bank account and unsurprisingly he was stumped.Avoid Sky Bet, their odds are poor compared to their competitors, their customer service is dreadful. The only saving grace was the UI of their app but tbh I haven’t tried out many others. I had been a Sky Bet customer for a decade or more but opted to close my account.",1

2022-08-30,"Used for over 15 years but a betting company to avoid completely. They do have a decent app and good interface but that's it. They are massively overpriced and almost all bets can be found with better prices elsewhere first of all. They ban you if you win and use promotions, this is true with sky bet,  it happened with a family member, you either lose or if you win they will ban you. I made a larger deposit than normal, as I was thinking about a bet however I did not and withdrew. After this I was contacted by Sky and my account was limited due concerns of my 'safety'. I was asked questions around employment, savings, gambling habits all of which I was compliant with and even sent in bank statements etc. They then limited my account (I think because I was not profitable to them), even though I have used this for 15 years, and the last 3 years I was approximately break even, in profit actually. They said this was because of my unusually large deposit and its for my welfare, even though I was able to make larger bets years ago whist I was not working and I was a student, where were the welfare checks when I was losing money in larger amounts...?. In simple terms, if you happen to actually have a positive balance with them, they will find a way to ban you and all the other profitable customers, so that you only option is to lose money with them.",1

I sent in a copy of my credit card statement, council tax, bank statement where the money came from, did not want to help. totally useless company.

2022-06-07,"Pretty livid to receive an email from Skybet this morning saying that ""Following a recent in-depth review by our trading team we regret to inform you that your account requires tighter restrictions in the future"", excluding me from any future promotions.  As someone who has got their gambling under control now, I find this a very shoddy move at best from a ""credible"" bookmaker, especially when they are quick to ""support"" safer gambling.They seemed fine when I backed losing horses in their ""Money back as cash"" races, but as I'd won a couple lately I guess that was it.  Of course promotions are going to tempt people into engaging (isn't that what they are intended to do? :D) - however seen as I was a member of the Skybet Club for a few consecutive months I was actively betting on non-promotional stuff too, mainly football accas throughout the season.  Their email seems ill-timed and the fact they do not even elaborate on why or give you a platform to argue your case is pathetic.  So shove it Skybet, you've literally taken the fun out of it for me, so as I told the Customer Services Assistant earlier - yes, I shall stop.  Account duly closed - after all why would someone leave an account there active when you've taken away a huge part of the fun.  May be a blessing in the long run.",2

2022-07-20,"The only thing Skybet does better over some companies is it gives you better ""actual odds"" than most. As for the negatives, there's lots. Doesn't give you an easy to follow bet history unless you want to aimlessly scroll for minutes to find a 2 week old bet....  Only extensive match options is football, as for the rest like tennis.... Lists sometimes one tenth of the matches of Bet365. Most importantly i placed a bet, won, gave me half the winnings that it should have. Attempting to find out where the rest has gone, good luck trying to get a live agent. Clicked through 4 pages before i found somewhere you could type a request for help. Typed in full what the problem was. Took me through to another page no closer other than patronising self help advice but wiped everything i typed. Typed ""live agent"" nothing, refreshed ""live chat"" refreshed, ""chat help"" clicked through 5-6 more pages before i repeatedly knew clicking on or requesting the live chat graphic lead me no closer to chatting to a bot, never mind a human!! End result, i'm owed money and no way of getting it. Bet365 has a lot of error faults, littered with them but they're very reliable and it's been my go to company for 17 years. Go with them instead.Edit, it's now the dreaded rule 4... Got told it's ""because a horse was withdrawn all the other horses have a better chance of winning"". Maybe so but a 19 horse race, where the favourite was still running and many other short odds horses and now my winnings were knocked down by a third. Disgraceful. When i eventually found the live chat, i wanted didn't even have the chance to reply in a mini kind of appeal, but midway through typing, midway through the live agent chatting, the chat gets knocked onto ""post chat"" no way of screenshotting the chat or talking to the agent, no way of backing up, just a blank screen.

2022-09-15,"The 1.3 star rating is unsettling whilst also reassuring. Unsettling that I have allowed this company to thousands of pounds in good faith, reassuring that I am not the only customer to have been treated horrendously.Promotion email after promotion, silly me completely my own fault thought oh I'll give these a go. I don't know why, I was perfectly happy with William Hill. I was a valued customer, their win to lose ratio is fair. I was given daily bonuses that were actually rewards. Believe me the grass is not always greener. By the time I was fed up with sky, I had lost all of my loyal customer bonuses with William Hill. I wrote to sky as a loyal customer to see if they would be willing to offer anything to make me satisfied that I had given up my William hill account for them. A high paying account may I add. I am simply told no, or instantly have my account suspended? Criticism is not something sky bet take lightly, but also do not try to resolve the issue? They simply suspend your account so you have to call a number that takes over an hour to get through. Once with an agent I explained I am a high paying customer, I feel very unsatisfied that their daily bonuses are either a loss or 10p. Whilst playing you get a drop down saying spend £7 more for a guaranteed win tomorrow, the guaranteed win is always 10p. The agent told me it does not say guaranteed. I sent a screen shot of the big gold flashing lights saying GURANTEED WIN, the chat was disconnected and my account was suspended yet again. I made a complaint, the service is poor and there is just no gratitude for loyal customers which I just find offensive. I have had a reply saying they will not be issuing any good will as I have asked multiple times, incorrect. The reason this query has come up multiple times is because the live chat is disconnected? The agent I spoke to on the phone was intimidating, I ended up setting a limit so that sky knew they would be losing my custom - nothing to try and keep me despite the thousands that have been spent with them - its utter greed. As a company I find it a disgrace to not reward your loyal customers. Instead you made me feel cheeky and foolish. To end your email with ""I sincerely hope you continue to play with us and we haven't lost your faith"" is beyond hypocritical. I have reached out to the CEO via LinkedIn, I will also be making this known on twitter. I don't feel people should sign up to skybet. The win ratio is poor, the bonuses are abizmal and there is no gratitude for your custom. As you can see a 1.3 star rating for a multi million pound company is beyond alarming. Its solid proof that they will take your money and not value value custom. Please do not sign up to skybet and I urge anybody with an account to change. I have been with Ladbrokes now for 2 weeks and have had better service In that 2 weeks than I have in 8 months from sky. Please avoid at all costs.",1

The constant requests for free bets are a concernPlease consider this your final warning in regards to contacting us to ask us for free bets and that any further requests of this nature will result in the permanent closure of your account.Stephen Hokhave you got a problem with me?15:04all im doing is asking a question for a promo that i thought wasnt new costumers onlyam i not allowed to ask?everytime i ask a simple question on live chat i always get this15:05so have you got a problem with me?Not at all Louise, however we can't have customers repeatedly contacting us to ask for free bets when there will be other customers queuing who need assistance with genuine queries.  You have been told this numerous times now and we have warned you about this in the past.  I have noted your account accordingly that you're fully aware that we will close your account if this persists.Stephen Him not asking for free bets i was asking for a promocan you tell this to your manager pleaseYou were asking for a free bet you weren't eligible for and we have warned you about this repeatedly, Louise.Stephen H15:06IT WAS A PROMOread again.Yes, a free bet promotion that you were not eligible for.Stephen Hi didnt no that!!i want to speak your manager pleasebecause i feel like im getting bullied here everytime i come on here15:08its not fair on meManagers don't take live chats Louise.  However, given the nature of this conversation and the fact that you're persisting with this query despite being warned against it I will suspend your account and ask them to review it and make a decision as to whether we'll offer you an account.Stephen Hexcuse me?you for real?you suspend my account for no reason15:09im gonna do everything in my power to get you sackedive done nothing wrongwhats a email so i can contact a manager directly?That won't be necessary, Louise.  I have referred your account to a manager for review now and I should hear back from them shortly.Stephen H15:10ive just copied all this convationyour our of order stephenhow do i make a complaint about you?im not being bullied by youbecause the way your treating me is unfair15:11Ok, I have had a response from a manager who has reviewed your account as well as this chat and the contact history and have taken the decision on behalf of the business to permanently close your account.  We will no longer be offering you an account going forward I'm afraid.Stephen Hexcuse me?15:13for what?i havent done anything?15:13im emailing skybet and im leaving my review on trust pilot im copying the whole of this conavtion15:14this is bang out of orderThat's your opinion, but we will likely have to agree to disagree on that Louise.  We have closed your account due to the repeated contacts to ask us for free bets, the large number of declined deposit attempts and the numerous safer gambling concerns that have arisen as a result of this activity and behaviour.  Taking this into account, we don't believe it would be responsible to offer you an account.Stephen HYOU NEED TO BE FIRED STEPHENYOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST METHIS IS UNFAIRi havent done anything wrong at allyour completely out of orderim gonna take this to gambling commsion also",1

2022-05-03,"So, over the past year I'm in profit of £3,600 which was made through small profits every month.  I've been lucky and haven't had a month in the red.  Anyway, increasingly over the past three months my bets were being more and more restricted to the point yesterday I decided to withdraw my money. For some bets my maximum stake were set at less than £1, what's the point?Today, I received an email stating further restrictions will be applied to my account due to their traders deciding on 'liability management' these included no best odds guarantee for me anymore, no free bet bonuses and maximum win payouts of £100 and some bets only available up to 15mins before the event?Now I withdrew my money with the intent of using other bookies but not through choice but due to how Skybet were managing my account in what felt like their attempt to minimise my potential wins.The gambling industry is disgraceful as illustrated in the Panorama documentary and various gambling awareness cases made.  If you win they restrict, if you lose they encourage you to bet more with spam emails and hosts of free bet offers.Parasites that seem to make the rules up as they go.Interestingly, I can't see on any posts on here a response from Skybet.  This demonstrates their contempt for their customers.  Even poor companies often make some effort to explain decisions or poor service but not Skybet, clown shoes..",1

2022-04-03,Placed and won a bet. Stake was put back into my account and suddenly ‘no trace of the bet anywhere’. Absolute thieves!!!,1
2022-04-01,My account has been suspended because I won several times and made withdraw money then skybet suspended my account without any reason! avoid this website they will not let you win or withdraw money. absolutely disappointed and also awful customer service. Skybet phone numbers are not working as well!,1
2022-03-30,Awful crooks...I had a decent win at Cheltenham then all of a sudden my account was suspended after numerous emails they said its a business decision and I can't appeal or know any other info! Stay well clear,1
2022-03-30,"Sky Bet likes to market itself as a fair, industry leading betting service but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Yesterday I got an email explaining my accounts being restricted and I’m no longer eligible for any promotions, yet they gave no reason why. After emailing customer services I was told they can’t tell me why I’m restricted because of internal policies. It seems this is a common trend with other customers as well. It’s ridiculous they won’t even give a reason why.",1
2022-03-29,"I recently opened an account with skybet, deposited £20, placed a five pound bet, but never got the intro offer of £20 worth of bets. I gave them a few days, but then withdrew my remaining cash. Shame, I liked some of their site features, but I felt like I'd been cheated. Plenty more sites around though.",1
2022-03-29,Restricted my account after an 'in depth investigation' with no other info. Not sure what I've done but they obviously don't like me making money out of them so pull that line.,1
2022-03-29,"Tony regarding extra-place races no BOG, I mentioned the very same thing 2 years ago on here. Firstly all bets placed to win should have BOG protection. However a shrewd punter always checks Betfair Exchanges and Oddschecker to see what the true price is prior to placing a bet.If the odds are generally bigger elsewhere and I’m backing win only with BOG, I bet elsewhere. If I’m backing EW I generally take SP with SKY as the extra places can be a saver. Why I don’t like extra-place no BOG races is if you take a price and there are non-runners the price you take will be subject to Rule 4, even if SP is much greater. Extra-place races as you say are a con. Use your brain and take SP when BOG doesn’t apply. BET365 are always the safer option as they are also BOG all races at least the day before the race and races like Cheltenham BOG and NRNB at least a month before the race. Happy Punting.",1
2022-03-27,I am surprised nobody has mentioned the extra place races so they don't have to pay best price guarantee. The number of bets where the sp is bigger than Sky's price is unbelievable . And you will notice how when you try to place a bet the price has suddenly shortened and you have to accept price change. It's a Rip off ! Who backs a horse in the hope they finish 4th 5 th 6th or 7th Nobody that's who !!!!,1
2022-03-25,"I wanted to check if I had received my Cheltenham £10 cashback offer. I was told that I don`t receive confirmation in my betting account and therefore wouldhave to assume it had been refunded (Not Acceptable).I then asked for a statement of account, which was sent but unreadable.Disgraceful service !",1
2022-03-24,"What majority of the people say is completely true! Been a member for nearly a year now, turned over solid amount of money...And now, wanted to take part of a new promotion called ""The vault"", where based on the amount of money you stake, you get lives. The more lives you get, the more chances you have to open the vault which takes place on Fridays and you can win up to £30000. You can get maximum 3 lives per day, you get one when you stake £5, two when you stake £15 and 3 lives when you stake £40. I have reached the maximum number of lives for 6 days (18), and this morning when I tried to log in I got notified that my account was suspended. Just the day before ""The Vault"" draw takes place. When I tried to get in touch with customer services I got an awful reply saying that the security team has decided to close the account without being able to provide a reason and will no longer do business with me. Bol*ocks! I don't know how they've passed the tests with gambling commission if they keep doing this to people! Definitely just want to take your money and once you start winning they just close your account and that's it! No one to explain, to one to complain to! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FRAUDSTERS AND THIEVES!",1
2022-03-23,Sky bet are bad choice of bookmaker here's why. I was a customer for over 2 years I had some reasonable wins but no big wins the first one I did have 250to1 they refused to pay which they can do. I had to take them to IBAS to force them to pay steer clear folks skybet welch on the bets,1
2022-03-22,"Awful company, if you have the cheek to win they restrict your account so you cant access free bets or any offers. They only want people who lose on their site",1
2022-03-22,Slots are definitely rigged deposited over 300 in the space of 3 months and never even got a feature beyond a joke,1
2022-03-21,"I have never ever in my life been ripped off with such bear faced cheek. I made a complaint and now my account has been closed, I can not play the ITV 7 or Saturday Super Six, I have been locked out of all accounts and the money in my sky account has 'yet' to be returned to my bank. The biggest rip off is when I had a Lucky 15. The 1st leg won, the 2nd leg my horse was a non-runner, 3rd leg there was a non-runner and the 4th leg won. They put a rule 4 on the 2nd and 3rd legs, 40p in the pound. How on earth can they enforce a rule 4 on my horse when it is not even running? A non-runner is stake money returned, standard industry practice. They say they can not close anyones account without the correct account details, YOU WANT TO BET?UPDATE:- They have just informed me that the balance on my account will be paid into my bank in 5 working days and the post bets that are in play will be 'allowed' to run and should they win I will have to contact their legal department to arrange transfer of funds to my bank. One star is way too much for these charlatans. I advise everyone to steer clear of these bandits. I will now boycott all Sky betting and tv, anything to do with sky in fact. I am now going to seek the legality of their actions concerning non return of funds.2nd update:- They say they are not owned by sky, they are owned by Flutter Entertainment PLC. So why are they using the sky logo and name? Dodgy as hell.",1
2022-03-18,Shame there is not an option for 0 stars. Decided to do the ITV7 for Cheltenham week. Was unable to sign and it said my 'account' was closed by me. When contacting SkyBet they advised that as I had cancelled my account with SkyBet a long time ago I was now unable to enter the ITV7 unless i start the account up again.I said I had no intention of doing that and was advised by their agent that I could not do the ITV7 then.Anyone adult in the country is allowed to enter the competition whether they have a betting account with Skybet or anyone bookmarker. It seems extremely discriminatory and as a Sky customer for other services I am not surprised by their actions.,1
2022-03-18,Excellent company free bets also. They payout if you win immediately and the bingo site is amazing too. They are very fair and if you read a bad review it’s because they are bad losers it is the best and only site I would bet with or gamble excellent experience and I’m not a fake I believe they are the best out there. Good luck don’t bet more than you can afford.,5

I contacted Sky about it and was told their security team had closed my account and it wouldn't be reopened but wouldn't give a reason. This same security team didn't seem to have a problem the previous months when I was losing money. I was also told I wouldn't be getting the nearly 400 euro I had saved up in the players club account (""WHERE LOYALTY GETS REWARDED"") over the years. I did request a copy of all the data the company had stored on me and all the companies they shared my data with. They replied on the legally last day with a ridiculous incomplete coded spreadsheet riddled with inaccuracies (even basics like my age was wrong despite me sending a copy of my passport numerous times over the years. Well done security).The website itself works fine so if you want to give your money to a lying, nefarious, law flouting, tax avoiding company; why not use these guys.

2022-02-16,Don’t send any personal data to this company as they’re using your information illegally. Don’t send them selfie with your id. I have problems with every instant withdraw which I never receive on time but after couple of hours and then they suspended my account and asking for personal information for no reason.

2022-02-15,"As a daily customer, I dont know how long I can stay with them now ,first of all no guaranteed odds on extra place races,then site crashing on a regular basis due to technical issues, then no race reviews until morning.

2022-02-11,"Cant see a lot wrong with Skybet, extra places given in certain horse races rather than bog is a bit annoying, and there arent as many poker players as there used to be. But overall a pretty good site and one of my favs. Insta withdrawals is very nice, in play betting very speedy and accurate, limited on deposit methods but all in all I give them 8.5/10.",4
2022-02-10,"Used Sky Bet for years and some of the reviews here are hilarious. People getting upset because they don't win! The very definition of gambling is that you are playing a game of 'chance'. To expect a win every time you play is just irrational. If you have a problem with not winning, then maybe the issue is that you gamble too much. How do you people think these big gambling corporations make money. Honestly, and I am being polite here, some of you are thick as two short planks. Anyway, I felt compelled to leave review even though I know wholeheartedly that they do not get looked at. The only issue with Sky bet and other gambling companies is their aggressive advertisements and audacity to encourage gambling whilst simultaneously imploring people to gamble responsibly. Advertising should be put to an end full stop as this is where most of their money is coming from. Other than that, Sky Bet is class, but I think that's because I'm not stupid enough to think they 'owe' me something for simply spending money or being a customer. Most of the reviews here are idiotic and embarrassing.",3

It's the fact they restrict you on Something you have a chance of winning on,1

SAVE your MONEY or take it ELSEWHERE! I’m unsure how such a market leading brand as SKY can operate at such LOW standards.Happy to take but NOT so happy to GIVE! They are not only happy to let you open an account deposit money and bet with it, but as soon as you win any bets and you try to withdraw any amount of funds they suspend your account without reason. Which is exactly what has happened to me not just once not just twice but 3 times.Each time has been exactly the same I win a certain amount not even large say £20 I go to withdraw my initial £10 deposit and account is suspended without reason so off to the live chat support to talk to a SO CALLED expert!SUPPORT EXPERTS more like CRUMBLING APPRENTICES!As I had been locked out of my account not long prior I had spoken to one of the so called experts who had me provide a plethora of information on myself including Name, Dob, Username, Mothers Maiden Name, First Pets Name etc to which I provided and told I needed further verification and that they was unable to help I had to send ID to the support email and they would get back to me in a few days.Bearing in mind I provided these documents on opening the account as for some strange reason they wanted them to prove who I said I was.So after sending more documents in and hearing no response I go back to the experts on live chat who have me provide all the info above once again to tell me they have received my documents and are waiting for the relevant team to check them again after hearing nothing I go back provide said info again and they reinstate the account no questions asked.Couple of weeks later same thing small win go to withdraw account suspended!Back to the experts who in reality seems like it’s some person sat at home who couldn’t care less about you, your situation or your money after providing all said info above AGAIN. I’m told that there’s nothing they can do and that I need to get back in touch between 8am - 5pm as this so called expert is unable to help and isn’t enough of an expert he needs to pass it to the other so called experts. So onto the Nextpert the kicker is that they need to see more VERIFICATION. I could honestly laugh If wasn’t so appalled at this company! They have had every piece of IDENTIFICATION I own I have sent them bank statements, utility bills, driving licence. I’ve lost count of how many so called experts I’ve had to speak to and provided god knows how much sensitive information to them when they are probably some random people sat at home that now know who I am where I live and everything down to my first pet and mother’s maiden name I have provided them with EVERYTHING except my DNA and the shirt off my back which they would probably take aswell if offered to then just be told I need to verify my identity again!These people PREY on the VULNERALBLE and ones that aren’t very tech savvy. The amount of people that they must do this to that don’t know how to raise a concern or go through the many hoops of speaking to a so called expert probably just give up as they make it so difficult to take anything back from them it’s virtually impossible!It is no wonder the CEO Ian Proctor has a current net worth of $1,620,000 largely based on the estimated salary and income of $559,350 lining his pockets by stealing from the general population and getting away with it!It’s also no secret that they are using software and algorithms behind the scene collecting data on your financial situation spending and betting habits and profiling you as to how much they can make of you as an individual and how much they will spam you with promotions! As published in the NEW YORK TIMES on March 24th 2021.It is also known they was fined £1m by the gambling commission in 2018 for a catalogue of wrong doing and money grabbing behaviour!How is this even possible in this day and age? It’s DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!THE GAMBLING COMMISSION NEED TO INTERVENE INSTEAD OF SMALL FINES AND BEING SWAYED BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS BEING MADE!CEO - Money grabber - Daylight RobberSo called Experts and Nextperts - Unqualified, Unhelpful, More service from your phones reception! SkyBet - you lose when you lose and you lose when you win!Overall avoid like the plague! Check any review online and they will more than likely be negative as this is the worst company to ever exist and needs boycotting! Don’t just take my word for it do your own research and see for yourself or if your feeling like being robbed and having all your information stolen and your soul deprived by death eaters then by all means make a deposit and start your journey to hell today!",1
2021-12-12,Had a problem and got on to live chat for the advisor “Rhys W” to be intimidating and rude asking about my deposit limit etc?? Now my account has been suspended due to me asking for his superior to contact me? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,1
2021-12-11,"Been with skybet for years and since they started boosting odds they’ve constantly voided for obscure and false reasons - they are ALWAYS winning bets and I’ve had about 5 this year - winning boosted odds which are voided before paying out for insanely daft reasons.Last night was the worst and I’ve closed my account because of it. They claimed that a boxing bout (top of the card) which was always scheduled for 10 rounds, was suddenly changed to 12, 10 minutes before the fight and then changed back to 10 as they went to ring… all the bets they had live on the market stated ‘10 round fight’ and the promotional boost didn’t state anything about total rounds. It was a win in round 1-3, after the boost won - they voided it claiming the odds were based on ‘12 rounds’. Showing NO proof, they wouldn’t even clarify who it was that told them the fight was 12 rounds. TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.I also had a winning football bet voided because Skybet claimed replays on a goal scorer showed differently to the OFFICIAL ruling. Imagine that? A goal is attributed officially to a player, and skybet void it because they think the replay said differently (claiming a slight deflection/own goal).",1
2021-12-10,Skybet paying a extra place on most races today another con not to pay best price guarantee when all other bet sites pay both when offering a extra place.

I backed a treble for 2pm kick off games, it was for Man City, Everton and Tottenham to win, but the Tottenham game was postponed, the bet then went suspended not allowing me to cash out when the games weren't due to kick off for another 45 mins. I expected some type of refund by the end of the day but no, nothing. I thought sky bet valued their loyal customers but apparently not. After using them for years, I can confirm I will not be using them again, I will also be advising anybody who does to stay clear.

For some unknown reason they have stopped me from using any promotions that are offered even though they continue to advertise them on my sky bet page, I have asked them twice on why they have done this but never given a straight answer. Tried to complain when finally given a e mail address but again to no avail just keep getting replies saying they need my details which again they already have.

2021-11-11,"I've used this company for the past 8 years sports only had good experiences . Recently I have started using sky Vegas absolute money making scam don't fall for the Mega spin offer for staking an extra five pounds during play. I have done this 3 times now and each mega spin the next day has stopped on a ten pounds prize only after about a second later to start slowly spinning again awarding two pounds. So for playing 20 pounds on Vegas slots plus another five pounds to access mega spins it's a clever marketing ploy. Mega sounds a lot of money doesn't it, it is a tool that encourages irresponsible gambling I contacted live chat only to be told by an agent that he could not trace my previous Vegas history. That is nonsense I've heard it all before from greedy bookmakers I have only spun mega spin 3 time's it could have been found. The wheel stopped on ten pounds 3 times i have never questioned this before. It started again around a second later landing on 2 pounds. Won't happen a fourth time I would rather stake the 2 pounds from my funds. Give all your depositing customers fair play. I won't be using the 2 pounds free bet. It has cost me over a total of 70 pounds for 3x£2 bets scam",2

2021-11-07,"This seems to be a common thing, looking at other recent reviews. I’ve been with Sky Bet for years and received an email this week stating they will be restricting my account, following a review by their trading team (removing access to free bets, promos etc)I asked (what I thought was a reasonable question) why they are restricting my account and all they would say is “we are not obligated to tell you” - the email and the correspondence comes across as condescending with little/ no respect for the customer. Like others (looking at reviews), I am a responsible gambler, only staking about £5/ week, normally utilizing promotions on football which I use just to enjoy the games a bit more. My account is up about £350 this year and about the same last year. It’s clear they only treat you like a customer if you are losing large sums of money and those that gamble responsibly aren’t acceptable customers and will be made to feel like cheats. I have sky TV, internet, sports etc and pay them £100+/ month. In my mind, it’s all relative. It’s a shame but I’m leaving Sky Bet and will go elsewhere. Not that they’ll care. Anyone reading this review that is a responsible gambler and wants to be treated as a human, I’d suggest going elsewhere",1

2021-11-03,"Similar to their recent reviews I’m a fairly responsible gambler and do it for fun. Haven’t won anything really, but not lost much either. Been with them years and now my account is restricted and I can’t bet on any promotions with no reason being given. I’m leaving them now and also won’t recommend them as it’s ridiculous and appears they’re not interested in you unless you’re an addict and losing loads of money. Waste of time is what I say.

I have contacted them, no explanation given. If they don't like losing customers, what exactly are they looking for. I bet for fun, plenty of multiples, not just betting on offers. The skybet club and £5 free bet was all that made it worthwhile. Generally their odds are shorter than everyone else. But I was happy to stick with them as I was generally betting small multis. No point betting with them now, unless they have a real standout. Mr Murdoch has been trying to pull me back to sky tv, after this episode, you've got no chance mate.",1

These companies are all take, other sites I have tested with similar results as sky are betfair and paddy power they draw you in and drag you down then when you have no money left they spit on you, it's gamble aware week this week who is checking these out the gambling commission  the response I got from them once you would have thought it came from a bookies not a customer support group .

2021-10-30,"Like many others I’ve been a member for years. Never gambled more than I could afford. Would deposit about £20 every 2-3 months.I’d normally bet the Saturday football midday Shot on Target boost, then if that won the Soccer Saturday boost. I’d often do the Sunday bet to earn a free £5 bet and then both Touchdown treble on a Sunday.In a week I’d bet £25 and get £10 in free bets. For 5 years this has been fine.Then a month or so ago I was stripped of my free bet earning ability without cause. I had £50 in credit and the same again in free bets, so I wasn’t in debt. In fact I suspect it was because I hadn’t deposited in a while over the last 12 months I’m £262 up. I’m sure BSkyB and the billionaires running this are terrified of this gigantic loss…What’s most frustrating is their app is so user friendly and I’ve had no prior issues.

This has happened several times and I have double checked that I met the winning criteria.On contacting customer services they made it very difficult to resolve the issue. They required every bit of personal data to access your account. Whilst I may agree that their systems are secure they can’t say their staff are. Giving that amount of personal data to any individual is opening you up to fraud.I suffered a major fraud in the past and after a police investigation it was a call centre member of staff who was giving card details to organised crime!No Skybet deserve their very poor rating.

Concerning the horse racing you don't get best odds so if you took a price at say  10/1 and it returned at 33/1 you don't get the bigger odds.

Yesterday a received a note to say all of my free bets were being frozen.   I tried to find out what I had done wrong (other than win) and was told trader can freeze an account for no reason (ie if you don't lose).   I was flabbergasted.  I suggested if I had behaved in a way that was wrong to let me know and I'd not do it... No reason was given and I was told hard luck.   Personally I think its really bad, if I was losing would they have frozen the account..... Doubt it.....its so dodgy and chdish.   Maybe I should ask for my stakes back on all the bets I have lost over the years too.    Was really surprised to see this and disappointed",1

2021-09-20,"Never go Skybet!!! Before about 2 years ago Skybet was fine but now they put you on a very restrictive ‘deposit limit’ which you don’t have any options at all. Look Skybet I enjoy playing sports in your App but I don’t feel I have freedom in playing by restricting a deposit to daily £25, weekly weekly or monthly £100. You even put in place a call centre if you want to increase the deposit limit just call the said number and when you talk to a representative they can’t even do anything about it. My observation and opinion with Skybet as an online sports player/gambler is that Skybet is very good in false advertising which only applies to people who are losing but if you are winning you will be watched out 24hrs making sure that you won’t be able to progress in your winning style. I self-excluded myself because I realise this online gaming/gambling only favour those losing players but if you are winning they gonna put you on restrictions. I’ll be back to the traditional betting such as William Hill or Coral.",2

However, the returns are shocking  even over multiple games to the point the win cycles feel very very very scripted.. the only way that I can describe it and to be fair it's my own fault continuing to waste money with them for so long.

I had a 10 euro stake for a few football matches and it all went onto the golf last weekend. The payout was 2k plus. All selections were in awaiting the golf.. From the final day of golf, I never had a cash out. However it was available in another bet I had done. So the big potential payouts cash out option was disabled. Not once over the course of the day did I have the option. I would have cashed out on several occasions through the final round of golf but couldn't. At one point my selection was 1/66 in play so my cash out would of been very high. Nonetheless my bet somehow lost but I was frustrated beyond belief as I would have got some return had I the option. To limit someone's cash out based on the winning potential is unfair and unjust .don't offer the facility if you are only going to use it to your own benefit. Disgraceful service..stay well Clear",1

I deleted the app and I'll never deal with any part of sky ever again. I tried to leave a review numerous times on the Google Play store but they keep getting removed, sky bet obviously doesn't want to let people know their app doesn't work. They are frauds and thief's.

I had waited 28 minutes to start the chat this was 5 minutes into the second half and the chat was answered at 7:07 and once the game had ended Joel ended the chat.

Quite frankly I believe it's legally grey as it does border on discrimination, can you imagine a restaurant refusing to serve someone x amount of food or tesco saying you can't buy as much as shopping as someone else.

Today, 17th June @ Royal Ascot there are 7 races and 5 are extra place races.... someone has done the math and offering an extra place or two must give them a bigger advantage than paying best odds on that race.

I managed to get through in 10 minutes this time and was able to schedule a call asap from them. I am currently waiting on that call. Hopefully i recieve that call soon and can get into my account to withdraw my money that i desperately need although knowing these criminals they will probably make me jump through a few more hoops first and make this whole proccess as stressful as possible for me.

Cash out seems to be a cash cow for bookies as they can claim technical issue not our fault with no questions asked as I also has issues with Ladbrokes previously. I am just glad it wasn't a large amount but it would have been better in my pocket than theirs.

And their opta stat “T&Cs” clearly state “regardless of its intent if the ball goes into the back of the net or forces the goalkeeper to save the ball is classed as a shot on target” yet they decide because this bet would of won and would of cost our clients a lot of money in pay outs we’re going to cheat all of our customers out of a nice little win. Also another point to add, any bets including a player in a football match are void if the player goes off injured within the first 10 minutes, but any bets involving a player who doesn’t start and comes on in the 80th minute will count, the audacity of it from these thieving clowns!",1

2021-03-20,Skybet for my experience is a good one for me I've not had problems getting paid out before and even though it says 2 to 5 days for funds to reach you I've always had it the next day usually late afternoon.I don't play roulette or slots I just back horses and place football bets They have had some good offers recently at Cheltenham and refunded me my stake on loser in first race.I've have read some of the bad reviews but I cannot complain as they not done me wrong yet.Hopefully they won't but we'll see as I'm now £75 up over last 14 days and have made withdrawal a few 3 days in a row and currently waiting on 2 withdrawals I made yesterday. I spoke too soon as everytime i have withdrawn my winnings I've always received it within 24 hours but not today they are quick enough to take your money but are the reviews true that when you start winning they don't like it. I'll see tomorrow if I get my payment as it says 2-5 days but as I said earlier I always had it within 24 hours but as its been Cheltenham it may be busier than usual.Edit:I changed to 1 star should be -5 they not paying out yet as I have been using my girlfriends card and claim thats why they haven't paid out even though I have had payout to this card before with no problems now I'm begging to believe rumors as when my account was down and I was losing money they was fine with that now I'm in profit this happens.They later closed my account making me believe the rumours are true that when you start to win they shut your account down,1

2021-03-08,Wow where to start I deposited 2500 pound on Saturday say 12.30 in the afternoon just after I signed up so first deposit  as I fancied a few bets . Placed a few big football accumulators and had my final 260 pound so tried to gamble it and account was blocked 🚫 bare in mind the account has been open 25 minutes and now blocked . So I contacted customer service who wanted proof of id etc I explained thats fine but I need access to my account as I've placed big bets and need to cash them out if I feel the need to whilst watching the games well guess what they wouldn't even let me look at my bets as account was suspended when they could have just blocked any more deposits . There customer service skills are shocking and you can only do.live chat with them no phone calls . Well I've sent them.my passport my drivers licence my bank statements and my selfie next to all the documents and my bank card I used guess what still account is blocked as I need to speak to to risk team whoever they are but the funny thing is they have appointments only and guess what there next appoimnet is 5 days away so I need to wait till Friday the 12th to get a call from the risk team who I don't even want to speak to but need to to get account unlocked.  I said to customer service do me a favour I do no want to gamble with you ever so please refund my remaining balance back to my card I used and close my account as I appaled by skybet.

Obviously they stood behind there we can get out of anything rule. 2 days! so obvious it sat there 48h without anyone else noticing it was so generous - I'd really like 48h to reflect on my bets with them that have lost over the years.

The chat assistant basically told me it does say about extra time in the rules which was my fault for not finding it and reading about it. But my grievance is that it should say it more clearer in the accumulator as it does when you click on the match and if this had been made more clearer when I placed my bet I'd have made a more informed choice.,1

2021-02-08,"I can only say avoid this bookmaker if you are looking to set up an online account. They claim you get a free bet if you place bets of £25. However, they keep opting you out, which means they rarely deliver. They rarely give best odds guaranteed, which means if you place a bet you often lose out. The odds offered are always half a point at least below the general odds offered by other bookmakers. Although I was able to show a regular profit, I estimate based on the odds offered that I probably would have been much better off with  other mainstream bookmakers. They are not an organisation I would deal with again. I hope I can advise you to look elsewhere if you are looking for a bookmaker that will offer you a good deal, fair prices and not continually look to take advantage of the punters that keep them in business.",1

They get you addicted offering free spins and once you're hooked that's it they've got you. You don't even win 10% of your money back because of how the games are designed. If it was in a betting shop they close at night but if you're on your phone it's literally available 24/7, and don't get me started on the adverts. Has anyone else noticed how many online gambling adverts there are on TV and then there's the spam in your emails. It's literally everywhere but they promote safe/sensible gambling WTH. How can we when it's those ***** who get you addicted in the first place and it's shoved in our faces. I know because I've worked in a betting shop and it's all about the little freebies they give out. That's what gets you addicted in the first place.

2021-02-02,"I have been betting for more than 15 years, would deem myself as a ‘expert’. Never ever had any issues with skybet, but my nephew has had a bet voided on this yes/no bet. As a betting man, a value of under £300 winnings is not that significant and I have actually self paid my nephew as I believe his bet is a winner and he was rather confused. In this bet it said minimum 4 choices, but he chose to pick all 6 - obviously for better odds. One of the choices were voided as a specific player got substituted at half time. Although the other 5 bets were successful, instead of winning the bet as a 5-fold the bet was voided. This is a bit of an utter disgrace as it can not be that difficult to change the number of selections, because it would still meet the minimum requirements! I’ve heard he went through the help section and it has been setup as a complaint. I can not imagine he has been the only person to suffer from a yes/no bet which in my eyes - is basically an accumulator as there are multiple choices, but instead as a single bet. Absolutely nowhere on the website does it say it’s a single bet, so how is anyone meant to know this. I told him to just quit his account and leave them, but he has an ongoing complaint.Just wandering if anyone else has had this issue. I’m sure it will get resolved, but skybet need to state that all those bets are not individual or an accumulator. Rant over, will give a 2 star as I have never had a complaint in over 3 years using the company.

2021-01-18,"Avoid at all costs. Sky Bet are unethical and base their business on deceit, ill moral rules and have as much transparency as a brick wall. To add to their disgusting manner of operating they are completely incompetent and even when you win a bet (and they have been unable to worm their way out of paying out or reduce your odds from some hidden rule) they likely won’t pay out either. Resulting in you having to site in an online chat or other method for a prolonged period of time for their online chat staff to describe their business as ‘having a shocker’ amongst other blasé comments. Honestly there are so many betting sites out their now who let’s be honest aren’t the most ethical, but it is the industry they thrive in, who are much more competent and transparent.",1
2021-01-18,"Would give 0 if possible. Astounded that Jeff Stelling is prepared to have any association with this bunch of crooks. EVERY single time I place a bet on the correct score of a football match, if I try to cash out, they ALWAYS seem to suspend the bet. On 3 seperate occasions this has happened, only for a goal to be scored soon after and then surprise surprise I have lost my bet !When you deposit money it is immediate, when you try and withdraw 🙄 they make it borderline impossible, with ‘can’t connect right now’ and other delay tactics to keep your money with them. Even then, when you finally get the withdrawal done it takes up to a WEEK before you receive your funds!!I am in no way a sore loser, I can simply recognise a cheat & a scammer when I see one and SkyBet, that is you !! When you contact their customer services to discuss your issue, they just don’t want to know. You are treated with disdain and arrogance. Biggest mistake you EVER make is downloading their app.May I suggest to all who read this that there a far fairer and more honest companies out there such as Betfair & Bet365 that deserve your bets !!",1
2021-01-18,0 stars these crooks deserve. I’ve just close my account as it’s a total fix. Every roulette spin is on a number I don’t have anything on and every blackjack the dealer wins. How can the dealer always get 20 and constant 21. Thieves,1
2021-01-17,Just another muppet betting firm!Have used Skybet on and off for several years now - everything is hunky dory when you the punter lose but start lumping on winners and wait for their attitude to change!Won about 700 in the fall of last year then placed a 200 bet on an 11/4 shot which came second at 5/4 - their oddsmakers are idiiots - they then e-mailed me to inform me that their 'account liability management team' had swung into action and that I could only have pitiful amounts on sine die effectively stopping me betting!I've got a new jingle for them -Skybet - it matters more when you can get on!Richard Wood.,1

2021-01-12,"I am another victim of the ""clear and obvious error"" get out of jail free card that skybet apparently like to play when they are going to have to pay money out.I gamble only with Skybet. I am no expert or professional, I do not compare odds and I lose more times than I win. Skybet do odds boosts that always look fantastic bets but very rarely win and I have lost lots of money to them on these ""fantastic"" offers. I placed one of these bets and to my surprise the 3 horses all won. Skybet were offering odds that fluctuated between 100/1 and 150/1 over the day and I placed 3 bets. Apparently they made a mistake but I had already accepted their offer, so I would say this is not my problem but I would be wrong it appears. They actually changed the bet to read ""all to win by 1 length"" mid bet!! They then changed it mid bet to read 33/1 (which is not boosted at all). Whichever way you look at it, they are not people of their word. I usually lose so have no idea whether this is a regular way they con customers, but the one time I have had a good win, they haven't paid me the correct amount. I would say avoid them, if you cannot trust them to pay out, what is the point of betting with them? I have asked IBAS to look into this and I am contacting the Gambling Commission. I am honestly thinking about quitting gambling because I feel cheated. They have moved the goalposts. I have foolishly placed a bet at the start of the season on Derby to win the Championship........can I void that saying with hindsight, it is a ""clear and obvious error""??!! It is not all bad news though. Despite ripping me off for £100s, they have given me a free £7 bet. WOW.",1

Yes, I've had to contact them more than once to settle a bet that wasn't settled on time (most recently 7 days afterwards) but customer service did always fix that.

Today I received an email stating ‘You will no longer be eligible for any free bets or cash credits offered as part of any promotional offer from Sky Bet’  I have been fortunate to be probably showing a small profit over the last 3 years circa £1k but cannot believe they have taken this action.  Tried contacting them on telephone number on email but no longer manned due to Covid (fair enough), so went through a Live chat to try and establish the reason but they would only refer to the email quoting ‘Following a recent review by our trading team we have decided that your account requires tighter liability management’.

During which time they asked for bank details, which I gave them, then they paid the money into another account. So I am checking the account that I have given them and moaning that my money hasn't been paid. When it had been paid into another account that is not used that much. Also I am looking for a payment from skybet and the payments come from a company called Hestview Limited.  I have posted this review for two reasons one to make people aware of how skybet work and when checking for winnings don't expect it to say skybet.",2
2021-01-01,"Would be ZERO stars if I could. Multiple issues with skybet. #1, Bet without fav at 17/2. Horse goes out to 80/1 and come second. Cash out of £40. #2, placed bet at 3/1. Horse goes out to 80/1 and you don’t get beat odds for places. Even though the likes of BETFAIR five enhanced odds on placed bets. #3, And this may be the more important one. If sky bet are offering you a poor cash out then collect it. In my opinion they’re manipulating the cash out as they know it’s not winning. And this has to be against the rules of the gambling commission. #4, 1 won on a 50/1 that went out to 80/1. And because I placed it before 9am. They only paid the 50/1. #5, skybet choose to select certain races where they give enhanced places. When they do this. Best odds guarantee become void.  Skybet are all about best odds apparently, But the last year which just so happens to coincide with Covid. This company has gone so downhill it can’t get much lower.

Contacted Sky via Live Chat to explain the problem where i was asked for account details, which were provided.

I gave the call handler the 3 addresses that i had lived at to be told i had provided the wrong address and my account was suspended. Provided details but still refuse to let me back into account.

They delay and give false results to mislead you to put a bet on that’s already happened. I have proof of this and have spoken to Ian Proctor the CEO of sky bet and he has passed me on to his team offering me a pathetic excuse of they are a bookies not a result service. What an absolute joke from a company that made 1.8 billion last year from robbing loyal betters. I have now decided to take them to a small claims court after being cheated so many times and now I have received a very threatening solicitors letter. I have proof that sky bet took 3 football bets off me. whilst giving the wrong score result. Again when I contacted Ian Proctor. He passed me to one of his team they said we are sorry and have credited your account £10..... are they kidding. They are cheats and I’m going after them. If anyone else has similar stories please let me know. I don’t no about Jeff Stelling how about Jeff stealing.,1
2020-12-03,"Just had a bet with Skybet.  A £10 promotion plastered all over their Homepage.   Fernandes+ Rashford + Mbappe + Neymar all to have a shot on goal. (3/1). In Man Utd v PSG (2/12/20)Neymar + Rashford scored.  Fernandes blasted a header at the keeper in 83 minute.  Mbappe had a shot across goal saved by DeGea just before halftime.   (This can all be seen on any YouTube vid Man Utd 1 - 3 PSG ).Skybet refused to pay out & kept my £10 stake, as they stated the Mbappe chance was a cross rather than a shot.  This is highly debatable,  as he was about 6 yards out; and either way irrelevant as the ball was travelling goal bound and required the goal keeper to save.  By ANY definition this is a shot on target.Skybet have stolen my £10 stake and are withholding a rightful winning of £30.  Good grief it was only a promotion with a betting limit of £10 anyway, so I have no idea why they would not just honour it for PR purposes?

Placed a 33/1 bet before the liverpool v leicester game lastnight won the bet then was notified that skybet made a mistake with their odds and was told i would only be credited with a 16/1 offer return. Basically said they mistakes 33/1 with 13/1 which is a complete lie as i do shots on target on a lot of games before hey kick off and the odds are always over 20/1 so they have lied blamed it on technical issue n scammed me out of half my profit the absolute Pusssyboys.,1

Asked for kyc 1.passport with selfie 2. 2 months unredacted bank statements 3. Picture of the cardProvided all and then received a phone call where the safer gambling staff was accusing me of not being the person even though sent passport with selfie dated on the day . 'Reason for this is I've been in the country just 3 years and my accent sounds too good'Then he said the 2k total deposited from my bank the month before was paid into my account by another person 2 days before I deposited it so now he is asking for that persons proof of Id ..

2020-11-18,"It's unusual for me to post a 1* review about anything; my feeling is that people who leave them usually have an axe to grind.But in the case of SKYBET, I certainly do. If TRUSTPILOT allowed for a 0* rating, that is exactly what this no-customer-service-scammy-sort-of-company would get from me.I was warned that SKYBET might be a dodgy outfit, I should have paid attention. But hell, they advertise themselves as an INTERNET TOP 100 COMPANY, so I thought that I couldn't lose. Famous last words.I wanted to place a bet on the riskiest game in town, the US Presidential Elections. As an expat yank living in the UK, I thought that as long as I was going to vote in this one via absentee ballot, I ought to put my money where my mouth was and place an online bet on The Orange Man.So I signed in with SKYBET, uploaded £100 to wager on my favorite candidate (at 2 to 1, I couldn't resist)...that is when my nightmare started:WHAMMO!! Within 5 minutes of receiving my £100 deposit, SKYBET froze the account and denied access...fair enough, they probably needed to do their due diligence on me and determine that I'm not some sort of money laundering escaped convict. I just thought it a bit funny that they waited until I had uploaded some money, but otherwise, really didn't think too much more, at the time, about it.I had to contact them, they didn't contact me. When they finally responded, they informed me that I needed to supply the following ID:A valid PassportA valid Driver's License (with current residence)A photocopy of my Debit CardCool no problem. I did that, right away. There was still a little time left before Election Day. Surely, they will sort something out for me before then?A day or so later, I had an email back informing me that that the photocopy of the bank card that I sent over had to be destroyed as I didn't cloak the middle group of numbers ''for security reasons''....huh, whaaa-what? This is starting to get a little weird, particularly as the whole effort of the sending of personal data via email appeared to me to be unsafe. They wanted me to send through another copy of my Bank Card, this time scratching out the middle numbers? Fine...I didn't understand it, it seemed somewhat unreasonable & pointless...but...whatever...I am, at this point, actually beginning to lose the will to live.About a week later (by this time the US elections were long gone) I received another communication, this one informing me that  the way I had cloaked the debit card number was unacceptable and that I had covered one too many digits...Huh, really? are they kidding? I must have misunderstood...or...something?NOW, this is definitely  starting to get me a little weirded...but hold on, there is still some more to come!...a day or two further on...another request...this time for a...Utility bill!Really!???  :-0OK, now! Now I've had just about enough of this, cr*p!...2 weeks have churned by--and we're still to-ing and fro-ing with this BS!...this is crazy and I am starting to get the idea that the intention of SKYBET may be to scam me out of my £100 (the irony is, I probably would have gone & lost it by betting it away, anyway)!Well, I suspect this review has gone on far too long for most people's tastes, but I will share one last bit of correspondence with any readers who have managed to last this long and are still awake.The last response of SKYBET to my communication was...get ready for this:''we are sorry for any inconvenience that you are experiencing.''My reply:”Inconvience is this weeks understatement.''I have supplied all of the information you have requested of me. If you check the  correspondence trail of our communications, you can verify this.''To keep supplying sensitive personal data to your organization over unsecured emails is, I am sure you will agree, pointless & irresponsible.''You have the right to verify my identification, you have also had ample opportunity to do this. ''But you do not have the right to confiscate my money. You did not require identification prior to accepting transfer of my money.''You shut this account down prior to requesting any verification, obviously you do not need any sort of license to option a customer’s money, making the process so difficult, unsafe and time consuming that in order to gain access to his money, a customer must waste vast amounts of time and perspiration.By these actions and the offhand style with which you carry them out, I do not trust your business to safeguard money, sensitive data or anything else, for that matter.''So that's it, dear reader, they've got it, my £100......and it looks as if they are going to keep it, too...this my story...don't let it be yours...businesses like SKYBET should not be in business.My advice is: don't be a fool, like I was, and give them your business...simples.",1

2020-11-17,The BOG is a swizz now. Out of 32 races today there are only actually 19 that are BOG. I think this could lose them customers. The virtuals appear crooked. Of course its random but ive done small bets on over 100 faves in perms and your lucky to have 4 or 5 winners.35%of faves normally win so there software seems way off. I understand its just bingo but other sites appear a better ratio. My account is up and I have withdrawn a £1000 and a £750 in last month and had the money within a week. I enjoy the site so I think its worth 3 stars. Just the BOG and virtuals that have griped me a bit.,3

2020-11-14,"After these shysters decided to remove their BOG for races where extra places are paid out, that was a game changer for me. I only place bets on a win only basis, so the new policy places me at a disadvantage.

2020-10-31,"Part 2Radio streaming Most sports companies offer radio and/or video streaming. But not SkyBet.On 31/08/20 SkyBet wrote “Regarding a radio service, this isn't something we offer unfortunately, as we have the racing stream service this isn't something we would be looking to implicate (implicate?) we can only offer our apologies there.” But you don’t have a streaming service!!!, didn’t you know? Or maybe you just can’t be bothered?Concluding Five months after the start of Coronavirus SkyBet don’t have their lines of communication communicating including postal contact, SkyBet don’t offer streamed radio because SkyBet don’t also have video racing streaming.  SkyBet decline to take their supplier to book and happily pay their charges for a service that is faulty for a number of months while spinning fairy tales to their customers and decide that those customers have no basis to complain while they say that they welcome their input, the CEO appears to be untouchable and couldn’t care less despite having been sent a recorded delivery letter which he declined to acknowledge.  To sum up, the customers appear to have no reason to complain because nothing is SkyBet’s fault or its equipment fault, or their marketing department fault. It is our fault because we are stupid for being their customers and we are a nuisance anyway. Am I wrong with my statement that SkyBet seems to be a Mickey Mouse outfit? Sorry, Mr Mickey.",1

I understand BOG is not a punters right, but I would rather take my chances of a reduced minimum field size, than miss out on a drift.

2020-09-13,Been playing for a few months get a call today to say they want my bank statements and provide them my income as I am down on my account so I went through it all and told them all information needed and they want my wage slips and stuff. I said I am not willing to sent private information and they said if I don’t they are closing my account so basically they took my money then closed my account. Be careful with them.,1
2020-08-31,Absolute joke of a site!!! Made a deposit from bank for it not to go in my account. Been over 24 hours now and keep being told it’s a technical issue which will be resolved. No money back nothing. I would advise new customers to go to other betting sites as the customer service is a joke and they really don’t care about you. Also if you ever deposit your money and it doesn’t go in your account you will be spending a very very long time trying to get it back.   I strongly recommend now people stay away from this site and use paddy power from a personal point of view.,1
2020-08-25,"Have to agree with the negative reviews given below. I have played casino games through a few sites, and by far Skybet has the worse payout and the bonus provided in the games is rarer than Haley’s comet.Am giving up playing their site and using others.",1

Also, those C@unts have completely removed my cashout option on all games. When I joined them they had cashout on all games even multi tickets with 6-9 games in one ticket. Now after a few wins, they lowered the odds to the minimum and removed my cashout fully. my phone or internet crashed a few times and made the same bet twice for no reason and no cashout was possible on a single game that starts in 5-6 hours.

Best odds guaranteed on horses gone until 9am of the days racing, always used to be the day before, albeit with a little point shaving. Yesterday at York in the listed’ race best odds guaranteed wasn’t included!! Withdrew from my account on  friday, early afternoon, and at time of writing this it’s still not in account. It’s now Wednesday and it’s only just arrived!!  Even with the weekend this is unlike Skybet of old. Used to be overnight by 3 in both my accounts. Anybody else also noticed the decrease in the extra place races’ that were available, loved nicking fourth in low grade races that were already 1/5 odds each way. Must have got burned too many times. Two years ago I had Skybet number 1 by a mile. Now PADDYPOWER smashes you out the park I’m afraid to say. Thanks for the good times though Skybet.",2

2020-07-18,"Definitely one of the better bookmakers. I've been with them a few years now and no real problems at all. They have good markets , they do lots of enhanced places on horse racing - more than the others. They even refund or void bets as a goodwill gesture sometimes ie a horse was very late in leaving the stalls and had no chance. Withdrawal times are fast and Customer support has always been pleasant if I've had to contact them.",5
2020-07-17,As a casual punter I've had occasion to use Sky Bet and the experience hasn't been wholly unpleasant.  As long as you are losing everything is trouble free.  As soon as you win a tenner your bets start getting held up until they can change your odds to something less favourable.  This made me uneasy but to be fair I was able to withdraw the money from my account with no problems.,3
2020-07-12,Joke of a company - AVOID!Signed up and deposit a substantial sum of money to have my account instantly suspended and documents requested.Fair enough requesting documents I thought but they took a week to review the documents and refused to deposit my money back to the original payment method.Eventually sorted and withdrew straight away - AVOID!,1

A complete disgrace,1
2020-07-05,I’ve used skybet for years. Just had a £41 win . Waiting on my winnings clearing I saw I had a placed bet and then another and another. Basically 3 Bet’s totalling £81 which I hadn’t placed. Online chat guy saying fraud team won’t speak with me because the bets were placed from the same IP address? Not a chance. So they closed my account and told me to contact police. They’ve taken 2x £20 out my bank and my £41 winnings then just lock me out. Absolute disgusting,1
2020-07-05,"Rubbish site, Account was suspended for no reason, They will not let me back on, Their loss, Use another site 👍",1
2020-07-05,"I have used SkyBet's sports book for years. The issue I have had is with a bet on a tennis overs market. The same totals markets that are offered on tennis normally were displayed on this match. The format of the match however was a very abnormal format that is never used in the regular season. Normally it is best of three sets. This was best of three but a tiebreak is played as the third if both players win a normal set. In this case, my selection would have won in the normal format that is used all year, as both players won a set and a third set would have been played for my total. In this unusual format, the total went under as the third set isn't played to it's full games potential. There was absolutely NO clarification on the match listings that this very unusual format of tennis was being played, yet they still were offering the exact same total markets that are used in the regular format of tennis. This is very poor on their part, as they should take some responsibility of at least making customers aware of changes to sports formats, particularly ones that almost never happen. Failing this, they could have, at the very least, lowered the totals they allowed us to wager on, but used the regular totals they display in full best of three tennis. I most certainly would have NEVER bet on this market if I had known this, and when I expressed this to customer support, their trading team essentially admitted that they werent making customers aware of this significant change to the format on the listings, and I was offered no help or consolement on the issue that cost me a lot of money. While this is not exactly a scam, its hardly short of that. Very bad practices on their part that allow customers to lose out under unjust circumstances. Disappointed as a loyal customer.",1

However, I had 'frozen' my card pending the outcome. This 3rd session was ended by their agent prematurely not giving me time to respond.

They informed me there were no knock downs in the fight, however on video it shows both fighters going down after being hit, which is the definition of a knockdown.My chat cut off to where I had to reconnect with someone else. While on this chat I said the wrong maiden name due to personal circumstances, my mother has multiple that are spelt differently.Rather than understand that people may have there own personal issues for things, he stated that you can only have one maiden name. Which clearly isnt true in my circumstance. Refused to ask me another question and went straight to asking for my ID.I asked to speak to a manager where he told me they do not deal with chats. Then he (Adam) told me I can if I send him my ID.So the chat advisor lied to me by saying i couldn't speak to a manager but then i could if i sent my ID? I no longer trusted this advisor with that level of personal information and required he put me through to a manager and I assured him it was not about my personal information, but to simply complain about the service I have had.Instead he continues to tell me I need to send my ID, which I wasnt because I didnt trust the individual and then he just ended chat suddenly.He had no right to end the chat, and I DO NOT have to send a picture of my ID to speak to a manager. If I do, please show me in your terms and conditions where it says that.Ridiculous wait times, being told I'm a liar, being lied to, having my chat suddenly ended and not being paid £110 for a bet I clearly won.I will never be using sky bet again, I have been a customer for about 10 years.

The odds are always in favour of the gaming company (something called the 'House Edge'), so the longer you play - and the more cash you stake - the more you’re likely to lose.""Which is so great to see some truths even if it may be a forced responsibility it is clear and not hiding the facts.Website is clearer than most so again no hidden surprises and withdrawals have been almost instant for me (using Visa debit card).Well done Skybet / Vegas / Lotto / Casino and any others I've missed.",5

2020-03-04,"I tried to open an account with them today after I heard an advert on the radio but I wasn’t able to deposit money because my Revolut debit card wasn’t accepted. I was told from one of their customer service agents that they are treating Revolut debit cards as a credit cards and because of the new regulations credit cards are not accepted anymore for gambling purposes my transaction cant be processed. I know it’s their business and their rules but they cant twist the obvious which is a debit card is still a debit card not a credit card plus their customer service is zero, the agent was arrogant and end up the chat without trying to assist me what else I can do.",1
2020-03-01,"Appalling bullying by this company. No wonder they have a 1 star rating. Go elsewhere...I had an account with a company called Surrey Sports, for over 25 yrs. SkyBet took them over and so then they now held my account. Bear in mind, I've therefore never opened an account with Sky Bet, nor agreed to their terms etc.This year they blocked my account, no reason, no call or email..nothing. When I rang, the guy went away to speak to his 'team'. He then came back to say ' we aren't offering you an account any more, so it's closed'. MY account had over £70 so they've effectively stolen my money. I said, fine..I never opened your account..you ve inherited mine, but you re not taking my money.I asked for the name of the legal entity that now owned my account, so I can issue a county court claim for my money. He then went away again to say ' the team will contact you to advise you about your money'Thieving bas@@@ds. Not sure if I will get my money. They simply took over a company that I had my account with and because the terms of my account are different, since I've not agreed to THEIR terms, they want to close it AND take my money.Just another case of how big companies bully the man on the street. They don't care, they do what they want. It's up to us all to stand for what's right, however small. It's not the £70, I hardly bet, it's just the occasional game etc but we should all take note.",1
2020-02-29,"Panzer 7: have been reading the reviews on this site and they have confirmed my growing fears that sky bet are at least a dubious gambling site and NOT to be trusted. E.G on their Prize machine competition i spun the wheel and surprise surprise yet again i won a 10p scratchcard and for the umpteenth time i couldnt play it because the game only loads uo to 98% and stops there, it never fully loads.they claim all their games are fully tested and verified by an independent source ( apparently somewhere in Alderne ) Lol what a joke.Lastly i tried to place a tennis bet on the ATP Dubai final and guess what its not featured anywhere on the site ( very cynical )could this be because Djokovic is in it and will more than likely win , so they would have a big payout ( COWARDS !!!) No more Skybet for me.",1

2020-02-07,Totally corrupt. Cash out on at least one match in accumulator always suspended - it happens sometimes apparently. Funny how it works on every other site. Used my £5 free bet on accumulator everyone of my 7 fold came in but the one that mysteriously suspended! There’s a small time delay so obviously they’re using that to decipher which match to suspend. Absolute rip off!!,1
2020-02-04,They cheat you had a bet on players how many shots on target there 3 shots on target sky bet put 0. Cash out always suspended. Odds are the worst going. Customers service is rubbish don't recommended any one to use this site. All there reviews a negative which says how bad they are.,1
2020-02-03,I have been a customer for about 10 years and have always found the service good.  I like the layout and basically have got used to the site even if the odds are not always the best. Issues have been resolved promptly etc.  However I have recently been informed that I no longer qualify for promotional offers on Sky Vegas or Sky Casino - the decision is final but no reason was given.  When I contacted customer support they are unable to shed light on why. Hence I do not feel I am a valued customer and I am currently looking at other sites.,2
2020-02-02,"Cash out kept freezing,wouldn't let me cash out when all winning,,a game was stuck on 14 mins for ages on throw in,,when rang customer services he said system does play up,funny how they start suspending games when team has safe possession till someone scores and your cash out goes when your trying to cash out!!! Coincidence!! Wernt doing that when it was losing !!!!",1

2020-01-20,"Hi,Just realised what a con the 'Top match Runscorer' market is, no wonder you offer a price boost !!Spoke to Ryan on the phone today querying the Sydney Thunder match on 18 Jan.The match was subject to Duckworth Lewis due to rain. I backed Hales who was out for zero and settled as a loser.I asked if Avenado (Top scorer at the time) was settled as a loser. He said no, it was void.The old rule of thumb in betting is, if you can't win, you can't lose but you've cleverly bypassed this with the phrase 'Unless the result is already known' to your rules.So from what I see everyone in the match who were out and scored less than Avenado is a loser. And whoever backed Avenado is void, absolutely disgusting after clearing up on those who've already lost !!I know that you void anyone who hasn't batted and rightly so. What about those in bat who were currently not out?Regardless, if less than 10 overs per side, your company is laughing and praying for every game as you can't lose, only win by those already out.It wouldn't be as bad if you paid out on Avenado but you only void him.Your ruling means you're really offering no value and conning the customer horrendously. You seriously need to review this type of market.Knowing now what I know I'll never get on this market ever again.I can imagine your odds compilers praying for rain and laughing when this happens.Your company should be ashamed of yourselves, conning the customer off the scale 😡I look forward to your dismissive reply,Sent from Samsung Mobile on O2",1

2020-01-18,I've had this numerous times now. I'll put an accumulator on (football) and when I check to see how my teams are doing I notice random teams in my accumator that wasn't there before and I never selected.

I immediately ran before the race went off and begged them not to put my £500 on this horse. I said under no circumstances do I want any money on this next horse.. I would leave me happy to void the bet despite backing a winner.. they refused to stop the bet.. after numerous calls and threats to take this matter further they said they would look into it.. every bookmaker I've ever dealt with all major ones take 48 hours to resolve it.. not sky bet they want 12 days.. I'm taking the complaint to ibis andthe papers.. how is this responsible gambling when a pensioner begs you you not to place money on a horse well before the race is going to be run.. remember the word responsible gambling they have no idea what it means..,1

I just happen to use one of them how difficult is that??. I then called to cancel my account and withdraw my money that I had on the account and was met with more rudeness being accused of being rude when asked to spell my name I said its exactly as it sounds. I was then kept on hold for over 10mins probably in the hope that I would hang up this after the gentlemen constantly interrupted me as I tried to figure out what was rude about what I said.

You lied to me over the phone no matter which way you spin it but you guys are making me out to be a bad customer that doesn't warrant an account.

Will be closing account today and telling them what I think of them. They are not fit for purpose. I cant understand why apart from an odd bet anyone would use them as their main bookmaker or show them any loyalty. They certainly dont show their customers any!

Plus I've tried for weeks to get £100 bet on a team to finish above another inthe Championship. No chance with Skybet.  Their site is a baffling waste of time.

2019-10-19,"Please do not use this company. I have had my account severely restricted and now I am going to tell you why. I have studied the behaviour of the skybet traders and compiled a dossier over the past 2 years and I now have sufficient evidence to prove that they have people on the inside passing on information to the trading team which they then use to put up so called 'price boosts' knowing fine well that these boosts wont be winning. They are cheating and manipulating markets to con mug punters out of their hard earned cash. I know which Jockeys, Trainers are on the skybet payroll and also have photographic evidence of skybet representatives sitting in jockeys weighing rooms and mixing with jockeys and trainers in order to gain inside information. People need to be made aware of these underhand tactics and stop using skybet. This brings the integrity of racing under scrutiny and I am sure in years to come we will find out what exactly skybet and other betting firms have really been doing in order to make their massive profits. Please pass on this information to others and stop people making these companies even more richer. They are defrauding the general public.",1

2019-10-05,i feel it is about time i reported this site. i have had many bad experiences. and its finally gone beyond a joke. skybet has on two occasions in the last couple of weeks stole two debit card payments at exactly 01:41am (including this morning) i got my bank to reverse the payment back. because i bet quite often on the football they think i will NOT notice when money gets taken out of my account due to many pending transactions. but i do. my brother warned me about them when they used to steal money from his account. but i did not listen. i have had to also call them when they have not paid out my full winnings on bets. they then refund me. if one team get postponed or abandoned the amount of money they take off your bet is ridiculous. the only reason i joined skybet was because of the fast withdrawal. which again has been a problem. i have had to call them to withdraw my money manually well after 2 hours. this thieving corrupted site DOES need investigating. see for yourselves people . . .  update 7th october after stealing money from my account skybet did NOT investigate my complaint. but decided to close my account permanently,1
2019-10-03,Stake restrictions after 2 days of winning bets. Even though they tell you that it has nothing to do with winnings or amounts withdrawn they stake restricted my account right after I had 2 winning day's streak and witdrawn £800.

2019-09-06,"The app is pretty good and easy to navigate. The profit loss function is also useful to help you manage your spending. However.. They definitely scam consumers. I had a football request-a-bet where 6/7 of the options were coming in on the 47th minute but it was only showing 5/7. It didn't show that 5+ corners each team had come in, which would have boosted my cash out. I spoke to them on twitter and noticed other users having the same problem, sky's response was that corners may not show until after the game, but not to worry as the cash out value wouldn't be affected! Of course it's affected, its another part of the bet that's already won, therefore the chances of winning the overall bet increase, boosting cash out value! I was just waiting on a player being booked.. The corners section of the bet was finally ticked in the 85th minute.. and the player I needed to get booked got substituted 20 seconds later. I don't think thats a coincidence. Thousands of people had this requestabet and sky prevented everyone having a decent cash out. Very corrupt.",2
2019-09-05,I think this company is going down. They treat me like garbage asking for documents from owner of the house which I am renting.

However I noticed a game had been suspended from the 64th minute thinking something had happened in the game while this was happening I saw one of the other games score a few goals so I wanted to cash out but I couldn't because the game on 64 minutes was still suspended and was suspended for 10 minutes as soon  as my bet lost due to goals on another game the game that had been suspended for 10 minutes by some miracle maybe God himself decides to unsuspend the game too little too late f w wouldnt let me cash out robbing c u next Tuesdays,1

Once you open a game after scrolling down it takes you to the bottom which is abit annoying. The bad thing I will say is the with the profit and loss which helps you control your getting I have staked over 42grand and won about 32 grand. The only I don't like about sky bet is they don't give anything to loyal customers just a stupid 5 pound free bet that don't count towards any bets, there 1000 drops in accounts and stuff they do I believe is a lie because I have never won anything from.

I really hope they choose to answer this review and explain why they believe the average person in the UK would own a firearm? I for one intend on looking into a legal challenge against Skybet on the grounds of prejudice. as clearly you need to be one of the following people A) of the hunting/fishing/shooting set or B) a member of a living history group C) a farmer or D) a criminal  these are the people you expect to require a gun.(though technically the last category tend not to licence their firearms). basically I question any company in the UK that ask for that list of ID from a UK citizen.",1

None of my information was mismatched and the only thing I can think of is the use of an apostrophe in my surname. My surname is spelt using an apostrophe and is recorded that way in all legal ID including the details recorded on my bank account and bank card. However, Sky Bet does not allow you to use 'special characters' thus creating an inevitable situation which delays account activation.On top of this, when trying to contact Sky Bet, I was on hold for almost 40 minutes (had to end the call myself). Live chat option was no better, no response in over an hour (also ended chat myself).Absolutely terrible service - jumping through hoops to activate an account due to their character restrictions, which in turn, forces people to misspell their names, causing unnecessary background checks.",1

Guess what.....it didn’t come in and sky would not reply to me as I was trying to call them telling them what the situation was! I have all the print screens and call logs on my phone with times so they don’t think I’m just one of these ones who is saying I’d of cashed out!

2019-03-06,"I was a member of Sky Bet for about 9 years and had a query regarding an acca I had. Their system doesn't allow you any control over an acca with even one game that doesn't offer live betting even though updates and live stats/frequent stats are avaliable quite easily at other places. On my acca all games that did offer live betting had come in and the two that didn't offer live betting under their system didn't. So I won nothing.For a company that preaches control and you..the consumer having the power in their adverts I found this rather unethical and consumer unfriendly that I had no control over this acca and wasn't able to get money for the games which I would have control over that came in or at least something back, like money back as a free bet for losing when I had no control over it.I contacted their customer service and was basically told that I'm wrong, they are right, there's no option to have any control or win any money on accas that feature games without their live betting feature and when it escalated further I was told that making a complaint wouldn't do anything and be rejected and when I got to the point that I had enough and wanted them to close my account they were quite happy to let me go even though I've been loyal to them for many years.All they care about are their profits and luring in new people with their offers but then are quite happy to screw you over and they also offer no perks or loyalty benefits at all for sticking with them. Their whole cash out feature is terrible too because games will have their selection suspended quite often for what seems like no real reason.After my most recent experience I will be taking my business elsewhere. I advise those who are on Sky Bet. Just be aware that when you have an issue or something has rubbed you up the wrong way. They are not willing to compensate or assist you and their is absolutely zero benefit for loyalty.",1
2019-03-04,Sky bet have a lovely looking site and loads of good promos but they will ban you at the first opportunity from all promos if you win with any frequency. They are the worst bookmaker site for this kind of treatment and as said before are only interested in serial losers. I had an account for several years and I went through a good run for a couple of months and they opted me out from all promos. There was no notifications or emails or explanation even when I pressed them on live chat. Bet elsewhere.,1

2019-02-25,"I have had an account with Skybet for over 1 year and was losing money every month....until the last 2 months when I actually won for a change.(I'm Still down but got a little bit of my losses back)To my absolute disgust, I received an email from Skybet stating that their 'Traders' had reviewed my account and they have set limits on what I can stake to protect their liabilities as well as denying me any offers/best price guarantees etc which are available to other customers. WHAT!!!!!! When I was losing all the time, I never heard a thing from them....proving the point that they begrudge paying punters winnings, even those who are heavily down!!!!  Skybet ONLY want serial losers......having read several other reviews, I realise I am not alone in their disgraceful treatment of 'Good' customers. I have withdrawn all my funds from Skybet and will NEVER bet with them again. However,I will continue to bet with William Hill who I've used for 14 years and never had any reason to complain about their treatment of me....winning or losing!  Skybet are a joke gambling site and they don't deserve the business of any decent punter! AVOID!!!!!!!  Sam   East Midlands",1
2019-02-24,"I have had an account for years and in the past yes it has gone through security checks and periods of suspension frustrating but apparently a neccessary evil that SKYBET seam to enjoy using.  I was using my account on sat 16/02/19 i had just had a win on vegas slots i went to withdraw and account suspended no prior warning just suspended there followed a period of phone calls live chat convos all to no avail while the all powerfull security team did their thing.  It then transpired that some member of SKYBET decided to SELF EXCLUDE me from my account how can they do that so i complained they admitted it should not have happened and promissed compo yes compo so i waited for them to lift the suspension which they did on thu 21/02/19 without informing me as promissed.  So OK account up n running received free bet in way of compo (£10.00) placed a few bets and go to use account, today Sun 24/02/19) i try n log on and guess what Account SUSPENDED jumped on live chat and after ages of waiting i get told that the Security Team have taken the decission to close my account and not offer me an account with them in the future, i am livid what have i done to be treated like a criminal i accepted there was nothing the customer services agent (customer services i use the term loosely) could do other than quote tc's at me but i created a private fantasy football league which me and my stepson both deposited ten pounds into they wont give us our enterence fees back and that is my complaint, i demand my enterence fee back.",1

I went to open the account sky did not follow any responsible gambling regulations,they did not ask if I was happy about my gambling levels and also did not ask if I wanted a deposit limit. The agent told me because the chat disconnected they did not follow on the procedure  I told them you gave me a 24 hour cooling off period in order to contact me which they did not. After I complained about this they suspended my account and I kept chat logs with the agent which showed that the agent said if we didn't go through the process we would suspend your account until we did confirm these. But my account was opened for more than a week and I lost some money and then I contacted them about the responsible gambling where they suspended my account.As I took the claim to Agcc they now said I can't have an account or have my account reopened due to responsible gambling issues. But If they had these concern they should of closed my account in 2016when they did not do and confirm the responsible gambling steps they promote on their website. I've spoken to other bookies and gamcare who said that I should of been put through this process but was not . Do you think I have a good chance  . It not about the lost money as I layed and made profit but they promote being a responsible gambling bookies when they are not.Also keep money since 2016 fraudsters",1

Tried to call customer services but couldn’t get put through for 30 mins. Played another game later and then called again, got through and the lady said that I had played the game and made bets! I said I hadn’t as I had been trying to ring them! She said they were going to suspend my account as there was a possible fraud and that if I was wrong they would suspend my account. Called again next morning and the guy confirmed that I had played the game and that the fraud team were not going to look into it as I had made numerous fraud claims before. I told them I have never made a fraud claim in all my time with them and had in fact only been playing poker for a week. He then came back to me insisting that I had played the game, and that as I had several claims on file they would close my account if it happened again. Absolutely would not listen to what I had to say. I am closing my account. Never again.",1

She asked sky bet to return the money and when she had time after Christmas she would send over the id. Sky bet refused to withdraw her own money!!! Absoulte appalled at being told she couldn't have her own money back she asked for the account to be closed and the money to be sent back! SKY BET have REFUSED to close the account and said they need to review it first. When someone wants to close an account there's no need for it to be reviewed it's closed and the money returned. After this she was told it would be 7to10 days maximum but it wouldn't take this long!!! it's been 14!!!! days!!! and no money. Every single day she has contacted sky bet security team refuse to come to the phone management refuse to come to the phone and all you get is the account is under review no time frame no explanation of what is actually being reviewed just robotic answers. it is an Illegal practice to keep hold of customers money.

2018-12-29,When my bets are going bad they seem to leave the cashout alone!! But when your bets are going great they put selection suspended!! I mean I just had a 20 fold accumulator over 3.5 goals 83 minutes going ok then two of the 0-0 games turned grey and stayed grey for 4 minutes until one of the teams messed my bet up?? Thing is as soon as the team scored 2-2 they instantly turned back to white its like they do it on purpose?? I swear I was watching the 0-0 game and it was going threw the motion attack dangerous attack trow in safe possession attack Safe possession and so on it's bull there was no reason for it to suspend my cash out?? It would and should of been a very nice cash out as well I'm outraged that they can take your hard earned cash and not give you a fair shake!! Not only that it happens all the time on most my bets?????? Sky bet sort it out you robbing set of thieves :(,1
2018-12-28,"awful. avoid if you have any sense. no decent loyalty rewards, poor odds offered and woeful customer service. odds reduce quickly in play so can hardly get bet-slip to proceed without more adjustments / confirmations or market being constantly suspended to suit them.  cash outs offered are pathetic.  not much protection for potentially vulnerable customers, very little monitoring of spending and countless emails sent encouraging more gambling even after periods of heavy losses.  use another service.  happy for mug punters only like most bookies. will restrict winners accounts quickly. stay away from casino and vegas / slots in particular pure fixes.  Be careful betting on their events, timing and stats like card points can be misleading and change leaving you well out of pocket. I watched one recent oz soccer match that I bet on for 50+ points which had 5 clear yellows shown, skybet later reduced it to 4 yellows and deducted winnings without contacting me and would not even apologise  stay clear",1

2018-12-14,DISPITE ALL THESE BAD REVIEWS SKY BET IS ONE OF THE ONE BETTING SITE OUT THERE. NEVER HAD A PROBLEM USING THERE SERVICE AND ALWAYS HAD A GREAT BETTING EXPERIENCE. GOOD ODDS REASONABLE FREE BET OFFERS AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM DEPOSITING OR WITHDRAWING MONEY OVERALL LOVE SKY BET.,5
2018-12-09,Sky bet are a disgrace. They simply closed my account with no explanation as to why. Phoned customer services who were utterly useless and refused to provide me with the reason it was suspended and subsequently closed just stating it was a business decision. There is no apparent reason for their nefarious behaviour. They’ve taken (Stolen) the money I deposited locked me out of my account and can not tell me if or when I’ll get funds returned. Humiliated and embarrassed by rude customer adviser - treated like a criminal through no fault of my own. Morally corrupt cowboys..... Would not recommend. Worst of the worst - would give zero stars if possible as they do not even deserve a one star rating.,1
2018-12-02,Sky bet have literally stolen my money. I had about £200 in my account. About a year ago they started sending me emails asking for a scan of my passport and a U.K. utility bill. I didn't get around to doing it and now I'm living overseas. They have now suspended my account.  I phoned and explained that I've moved overseas and need to close the account and withdraw the money. They said the only way to do that is unlock the account by sending a current U.K. Utility bill and passport scan. I explained that I cannot send a current U.K. Utility bill because I am not living in the U.K. They said that in that case there is nothing they can do and they'll keep my money. How is that ok? If they were planning on suspending my account unless I sent all the extra information they should've have told me before they did it! They've just locked me out and made it impossible for me to do anything. They kept me hanging on the phone on hold from overseas for 40 minutes to get to that point too. Words fail me.  I transferred funds in good faith and they changed the rules without warning and have made it impossible for me to get my own money back. Isn't that theft? Don't use skybet. Just don't go there. They aren't right,1
2018-11-28,"I feel like a victim. I have 2 withdrawals missing totalling £475. I have truly made a mistake in placing my trust in this nefarious company. They make me feel sick. My bank assure me they have multiple issues with withdrawals from Skybet that are still held with Barclays who are the service that Skybet use. I asked for help with Skybet and fair enough they swiftly offered a standard procedure to track withdrawals via a ARN number. I shared this with my bank and I was advised its still with Barclays and in fact the senior management at the bank are trying to nudge  Skybet to take action (no exact details on this but no statement from Skybet). No reply from Skybet which is really sinister considering its not isolated to a few customers. Make a statement at least!  Lord forbid there are people caught up in this who are professional gamblers or even casual ones who are perhaps looking forward to that money for something special...Anybody know who you complain to, to get this addressed. In principal I'd like someone to be professionally dealt with be that at Skybet or on the banking side, quite frankly they can shove the money its gone beyond that.",1
2018-11-22,Best site I've been on so far. Only downfall is the suspension of your account while you are being verified for withdrawal. Looks like most other reviews are from people who don't know when to stop. Thank you skybet /casino/vegas,5
2018-11-11,Did not pay me on a cash out bet. I have multiple screen shots clearly showing they admit to the cashout amount but yet they still refuse to pay out. Already 10 emails and they keep asking the same questions and I keep answering..This skybet is a scam!!!,1

2018-10-17,"Firstly I will start by saying I don't work for nor am I affiliated to any betting or Gaming companies. This review is an honest review and is based on my experiences with Skybet.We'll start with the Pro's (there aren't many)1) I personally have never had any issues with withdrawing money or having my my account suspended. Any withdrawal (to PayPal) has been smooth and within 60 mins. Most take 4-12 hours. It's a real plus and one of the reasons I use them occasionally.2) If, like me; you like to bet on over/under goals in football, they offer markets on all matches they offer. Not all bookies do (they usually have one option) and it's nice to have that option.The cons (I'll keep these at as high level as I can)1) the Android app is clunky at best. it sometimes takes ages to load markets (and by then you've lost the market you wanted to bet on) It's basic and takes far too long to render. I work in IT development and this would never pass test for release to the public.2) Through the Android App, you can't deposit through Paypal correctly. It goes so far and hangs. Very frustrating. You have to log in through a mobile browser and try again, then it works seamlessly. A bug that hasn't been fixed for months. Other bookies work fine.3) Winning bets take 2-5 mins to settle. This is a problem if you've put all your capital into a bet, it wins and you want to quickly place another bet. You've lost the moment. Trust me, this is hugely frustrating. Bet365 (for example) is immediate, I mean 2 seconds!4) Odds! I'll give 2 exact examples I've seen lately but in general their odds are way way below par of the competition. 2 football matches were 0-0 at half time and I wanted to pace a bet on 1 goal being scored in the second half in both games. Skybet we're offering 1/9 (Bet 365 1/4) and 1/8 (Bet 365 1/3) respectively. This means Skybet odds were twice as short than that of Bet365.I've also see at the start of a game for over 0.5 goals 1/150 (Skybet) and Bet 365 1/66. This is a HUGE difference.In general, on any market you select, Bet 365 (and probably others) will beat Skybet.5) Notifications on winning bets (or general events) work only some of the time. Very annoying because you have to keep picking your phone up to check your bets.6) Both their website and the App EAT your battery. I mean like twofold! Not sure why others don't (as much) but if you bet most of the day you'll have no battery in 4 hours.7) ZERO customer loyalty program. Other bookies give you free bets/cash monthly. I've had nothing from skybet. Ever!All in all if you put the above together, it's not a great experience. It baffles me that a company the size of skybet being cash rich and, offering odds that are way below the market rate (making them more money) do not invest in the platform that is their core business. I can't comment on their customer support as I've never called them, but if it is as good as the TV side, I suspect it's not a great (and easy) experience either.To conclude, a cheap, clunky platform offering shocking odds; I'd go elsewhere.They've had enough of my money for zero return in investment into their platform. I continue to bet, just elsewhere.",1

All I was told it was a trading decision, these guys should not have a license to take bets. All they are interested in is taking money on lop sided casino games where they can't lose.

2018-08-26,"I'm a regular gambler (as in multiple bets daily) and have used pretty much all the major gambling companies that operate in the UK. Without a shadow of a doubt, Skybet is by far and away the best for many reasons.Firstly, there's no waiting days for winnings to be paid. I operate all my deposits and withdrawals out of PayPal and funds are usually with me inside 20 minutes.Secondly, their customer service team cannot do enough for you. All of my promotional free bets are credited like clockwork every Monday and they bend over backwards to ensure that you're looked after.Finally, the range of markets available are fantastic. I have found a number of boxing and baseball markets which simply aren't available with other bookies and therefore wouldn't hesitate to recommend Skybet to anyone looking to set up a betting account",5
2018-08-25,"I was watching an eSports game and thought I’d place ny first ever bet. Sorted my account out and found a great bet. I was thinking it through and when I decided to go for it SkyBet hit me with a message demanding I upload photos of relevant ID. For starters who has that laying around and who the hell asks for that right before allowing you to place a bet??!? Bit much to ask. Anyway I shrugged it off as it must be some law I wasn’t aware of and after checking if it was legit I uploaded a picture of driving license and passport.This is when the crappy experience really kicks in.I look at the terms and apparently the verification can take up to 72 hours! What??! The whole damn quarter finals will be over by that point!The match begins and of course the bet disappears and I can’t place it anymore. Which naturally frustrates me.I’m just sat checking out the other bets whilst I’m waiting and I make a few slips to see what I could go for now; without attempting to process them.Suddenly I get a message in the app:YOU HAVE RECIEVED TWO WARNINGSWTH???! Why?? Who knows as I never get told.So I think, you know what SCREW this I’m out.But of course. You can’t leave easily. No no no.You have to email in to get your account removed which is bad enough. So I do so. Meanwhile I look on the app and ..My account has been SUSPENDED. What??? Why? Again who the hell knows as I never receive communication.Then the guy on the email asks for my details to remove my account. By this point I just don’t care and give him the details and am done with it.No communication, no context and no concern for customers whatsoever. They ruined betting for me.Ludicrous display.",1

Tried getting support through chat, failed, followed up with 2 emails that were answered a week later. Tried to call, on hold for 20 minutes 'we are experiencing high volumes of trafffic', Sat morning 8am.Not to mention the on-hold music that in a very short space of time, has you looking for the nearest bridge to jump off.Needless to say life is to short for this kind of experience, so that's that.Lastly, if this is representative of the level of support you receive trying to give them money, what would they be like once they have your money?

I've had this before on the US Masters they were originally paying 5 places but later increased this to 8 and I was still paid for players for who finished between 5 & 8.When the tournament finished I had the winner which they paid straight away and the 7th and 9th place,  they didn't pay me for those.   I contacted Sky today to query why I hadn't been paid,  I was told that my bets were placed prior to the 10 places being offered and that my bets only qualified up to 5 places!   I find that totally out of order and to be honest a complete rip off,  when they were bragging about paying 10 places  it didn't say underneath new bets only or existing bets excluded.I will be closing my Sky bet account and shall advise others to avoid this company totally unfair and a rip off.",1

My first bet won so no free bet was awarded and my second bet and subsequent free bets lost and then they graciously sent me an email informing me that my account had been restricted and that I was no longer entitled to anymore free offers from them, sports, casino, bingo etc.WHAT A JOKE SKYSCUM!

2018-07-11,"They had impressed me with the fast withdrawal system that they had; you could make a withdrawal and if it was with Barclays Bank and the withdrawal was under £500, it would make it's way to your bank account almost instantly but they say up to 2 hours just in case.They have been tolerable for the majority of the time but when it comes to money I feel like when mistakes/issues arise there is little room for forgiveness. The issue I'm having is that SkyBet is taking an abnormal amount of time to pay out winning bets. It ranges from almost 15 minutes after a horse racing win and over 30 minutes for a virtual bet win.The stakes I play at would not warrant anyone to manually process the payout and with virtual betting the result is predetermined so everything should be automatic. I imagine it's a fault in the system but one that really can't be tolerated. If you're a casual sports gambler who will make long term bets then it's not really an issue but if you're the type to make a bet, it wins and you're waiting on the pay out so you can make another bet, it's not really reliable. It's seems like a frivolous issue but when it happens to you and at a certain time, it's annoying.Oh, actually there's another big issue as well; the chances of contacting someone via live chat are slim. There is no queue to be seen and all you see if a spinning wheel. I have spent 30 minutes plus waiting to chat to someone and when it got up to that point I just gave up. You can obviously call up if it's an urgent issue but sometimes it isn't so urgent that you need to call but then you don't want to be waiting 30 minutes just to get the issue resolved.",2

If you start to make any sort of money on a regular basis they either limit your bets or suspend your account. To top it all off they took double a deposit from my bank and when I questioned it with them they said I needed to speak to my bank. My bank refunded me the money and then Skybet suspended/closed my account saying ""we can no longer offer you a service"".

2018-06-08,"Similar story to others, I was with SkyBet for a couple of years betting between £10/£20 a week on average losing most weeks.From December 2017 I started winning on the darts and football to the tune of around £700.I withdrew some cash left £200 in then my account was suspended.It took me around 12 weeks to get my cash... passport / Bank statements / photos of my bank card. Once you send this information they ask for photos of you holding the documents. Once you send these another week or so passes contact them again then they say the photo wasn't clear enough or deny they have received this at all especially if you upload in a chat rather than email. Delaying tactics.Basically they will drag it out to the point I told them I was going to visit their headquarters in person bringing all my identification and a urine sample just in case they wanted that too.In a nutshell if you want to lose money they will gladly take but if you win they will shut your account down. If they do owe you money DO NOT go to IBAS  SkyBet T&Cs include a sentence which states: “Where a dispute is referred to our alternative dispute resolution [ADR] provider, the resulting decision shall be final and binding and you therefore will not have further recourse to the courts.”Therefore you cannot refer a betting dispute with Sky Bet to the courts in the event of an unfavourable ADR ruling.",1

To be honest, I don't know if I'm up or down at SkyBet but I don't let me wins/losses determine my review. I thought it was sad seeing Skybet with 1 star reviews because I consider it to be one of the best, if not THE best bookmaker.The website just works. So many other bookmakers I have issues with the websites being slow, glitchy and completely outdated. However, at SkyBet the website is just so perfect on PC. The app is also so slick and has no issues at all. The promotions SkyBet run like the Saturday football acca boosts and great. They also have fun little bets you can make such as a list of 5 popular teams playing, you can bet for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 of them to win their matches which is a unique little way to have a flutter.The only reason I had to knock a star off is due to the customer service. I noticed it can sometimes take quite a while to connect to the live chat. I had an issue with a bet not settling and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information so I ended up phoning, which took over 20 minutes if I remember correctly. Could do with a few more free bet offers also :-)Still, the best website/app of any bookmakers in my opinion. I wish other bookmakers invested in making their sites as smooth as yours.",4

2018-04-30,I was 24 when they took advantage of me . They didnt ask me any question about my gambling or go throught the process like genuine caring companies like 365 do. They kept my money which was left in my account still. Report these people to the police everyday and ps leon you cant investigated anything i will see you in court.,1

Tried to call - gave up after 30 minutes of listening to horrendous on hold music.  Having read other reviews, I appear to be very lucky in that it's only £65.00 of my money they won't let me release.",1
2018-04-29,"I put money on wolves to win the championship before a ball was kicked. Ok thought the odds were pretty low. The bet I placed was for them to win the title at 8/1They paid out, saying I placed a each way bet, which of course I didn’t .The bet disappeaed from my settled bets when I queried it, I’ve asked for proof of the bet placed however no one seems to be interested...,,Stay away,  their odds are lower than the big players & they don’t want to pay out. !!!!!!",1

No!Hours on the phone again added a different card, was told I had to split the withdrawal they paid the smaller portion of the split then blocked my withdrawals. They have had my money for weeks and still not resolved.Scammers!!! Avoid at all cost!!",1
2018-04-25,The worst thing about them is when you do an accumulator and select only teams that are eligible for cashout. Then when the games start they always make one ineligible by saying live scores arent available thrrefore removing the cashout option.,2

2018-04-15,"**Avoid** I used these guys for the Grand National. The good news is that we won but that's when the trouble starts... trying to withdraw funds from this company is almost as difficult as trying to speak to one of their customer service team. 24 hours later the issue remains unresolved but I have now managed to speak to someone - I find it odd that they have such limited options to add and withdraw funds... no Paypal, Bank Transfer etc... They have now promised to return the funds via a manual Bank Transfer.Three phonecalls and over an hours on hold... come on Sky sort this shambles out!The issue is now resolved and I have closed my account.

2018-04-13,"Poor experience as a punter - had bets quickly reduced to the point where using them became impossible, unless I wanted £1 bets only. As an affiliate had large player base and earnings stolen. The board of SkyBet are short-sighted, devious and dishonest. Stealing from people - customers and business partners alike - is the reason SkyBet's reputation is rightly in the gutter. Honesty makes businesses more money (like the excellent Bet365) - and that is all SkyBet care about: money, money, money.",1
2018-04-12,Terrible customer service...spoke to an advisor after approx 45 mins of tedious repetitive music and woman’s voice apologising for the delay..only for the idiot advisor to put me back on hold. Will use a different website.,1
2018-04-12,"I self excluded from SkyBet and they refused to return my remaining funds. I got them in the end, but what a stressful hassle. It was like trying to negotiate with someone who just stole your wallet. Not sure how they keep their betting licence. The Gambling Commission must be very inefficient or simply want the licence fees and don't give a stuff about punters. Also had a friend who was limited to very little when he had two winners in a row. He is not clever, just got lucky. That is simply a scam. SkyBet should either offer a proper service or close down. At this stage, the Gambling Commission should be shutting them down. They dont even pay taxes properly as the parent company 'Bonne Terre Ltd' is based in Alderney tax haven but all their business is in UK. They use Leeds address for parent when it is an Alderney company. Google et al get hammered, yet SkyBet blatantly aren't paying taxes due on UK derived turnover. HMRC should look into this. A message to SkyBet and any bookies who follow their lead in future: Don't con, scam and steal from people and expect them to stay quiet about it. Very dubious about some of the good reviews here because I know a lot of gamblers and they all have terrible things to say about this badly managed and dishonest company. I suspect any positive reviews are by staff or shareholders. Avoid SkyBet.",1
2018-04-12,"Maybe I've just been lucky but cant understand all the bad reviews. I've been a Skybet customer since 2001 and they are by far my favourite betting company. I deposit and withdraw by Paypal and usually have my winnings within 20 minutes of withdrawing which is better than any other company I've used. Customer service has always been great with me (one small gripe maybe being that they can take a little time to reply to emails). Will continue to be my first choice for gambling, keep up the good work!!",5

No other bookmaker is asking for this.Also i am on the electoral role etc and thus can easily be identified without going through this.They have not responded to 3 requests to explain why they need this info.Be careful. Its smells wrong to me.,1
2018-04-08,Can't believe amount bad reviews.  All I can say are positive things.  Yes I've lost money to skybet/Vegas gambling but on many times I've won.

Obviously a few days later sometimes you are not as strong so I only blocked games and carried on betting on sports for months. They claim they tried to call me reference responsible gambling but they didn't get through so gave up, no emails or evidence. I believe if someone emails them and asks to be blocked they should assume all services not try and reel you in to other",1

Card failed checks even though charge on bank account showing check was fine. 8 X phone calls on hold for 45 minutes at a time until they cut you off. 3 days later I finally get through to be told can I send copies of all kinds of paperwork to prove identity. Asked why don't they ask for this when you open the account. He couldn't answer. Said the reason you can't get through to them is because they having lots of calls for same problem. Doesn't that say something sky?!! Then said it usually takes about 72 hours to sort out after they receive documents but will probably be more like a week because they over run with it all. And they keep your money until it's sorted. Plus they won't let you close your account until you go through the process. Live chat is just people using copy and paste. That's after spending 1 hour 15 mins waiting.,1

2017-12-16,"I honestly wouldn't bother with skybet at the minute. A lot of the other reviews are correct In saying that games get a cash out lockout for absolutely no reason. Sometimes you'll find games are locked out in a (Probably winning) acca, and not in others. Sometimes they're just locked out for no apparent reason while you can see the match readout changing from 'safe possession' to 'throw-in' etc (more likely towards the end of a game). I appreciate they probably suspend to change their odds on certain markets but that can't take 5-10 minutes. They've also changed their desktop site to the mobile site, which is fine.. on mobile. It kinda frustrates me that they have staff on here answering questions and defending their cash out problems yet it all seems so, intended? Also, recently compared match stats (shots on target, corners, shots off target etc) to a mates on bet365 and they almost seemed reversed, or completely innacurate. Strange? Makes inplays difficult through your service.Customer service is pretty good, though. I just used my last few quid and intend to go back to 365.",2

Had a five fold acca that didn't look like it was going to come in...that changed in the 87th minute. All teams were winning and my intention was to cash out. However from that point onwards cash out was unavailable. Regular users of sky bet will know that when something significant happens in a game the game goes grey and cash out is unavailable for a short time. In my acca it showed a yellow card being issued in 90th min when the actual game time, according to sky bet, was 86th min therefore game stayed grey and cash out was gone. Then one other result changed in the acca in 93rd min and all hopes gone. I've heard about bookies being dodgy with cashout but thought it was just sore losers. Really disappointed with sky bet and after the rest of my bets are settled may decide to use someone else. Feel like I've been conned",2

Since i posted Sky Bet the information they requested, which i believe exempts me from any wrong doing (not that i did anything wrong to begin with, except win money). Now when i phone Sky Bet or chat to an adviser by live chat and ask about my account being activated, they tell me that it takes up to 48 hours to activate my account then that changed to 72 hours and now..they can't give me a specific date or time scale as to when my account can be activated. Basically, they are doing all they can to avoid paying out my winnings or activating my account again. I have contacted them and made a complaint, but if there re-activation of a suspended account farce is anything to go by, then i don't expect anything to come from a complaint. I have read reviews on here about Sky Bet, and it's so annoying to see Sky Bet post on here to contact them via there customer service! It's like flogging a dead horse..leads absolutely nowhere...This is the first time i have ever posted a review, but since i was ripped off from winning £2700 & had my account suspended by Sky Bet. I just don't want anyone to experience what i have or feel or think they have won money and then.........You receive an email from Sky Bet, the same email that within a few days or weeks, makes you begin to realize, that after complying with what that email asks for, you are not going to get any of your winnings, let alone you're account activated. So writing from my own experience, i would advise each and everyone to AVOID Sky Bet.",1
2017-11-05,Can honestly say I've never had a problem with sky bet or anyone I know has had trouble with them I left all other sites and have sky as my main one I only bet on football an horses do some great special bets on the football withdrawals also speedy only downside of.you withdrawl on Friday or Saturday you don't get it till Monday but any other day threw out the week.it normally in.your account next day usually takes around 14 to 18 hours to hit account if they where to speed the withdrawals up I'd say they would be one of the best about.,4

I did not expect them to close it immediately with a substantial credit balance on my account which they are refusing to return. This company is unethical - avoid them at all costs.",1

2017-10-20,"Although I can see a lot of very negative reviews (Some that look genuinely frustrating, some from sore losers) I must admit I've never really had a problem with Skybet.I primarily bet on the horses and football (I steer away from slots and casino) and find it quite easy and enjoyable to use.Pros: Extra place races is a good feature.Very quick withdrawal times (even receiving one on a bank holiday last Easter)Had to use the online chat once for an enquiry and was dealt with quickly and politely.Bonuses are always welcome.Cons: Other companies do have better odds.Site can be a bit slow at times compared to say, 365.This can cause the occasional problem if you're attempting to get to an inplay market quickly.Not all bets are available for cash out (for example lucky 15's). Hopefully that's something they'll look into as some other bookies have.I understand people complaining about the cash out facility. But, I'm yet to come across an online bookmaker who don't make it unavailable when you get into 90 minutes plus.All in all, Skybet can be improved, but I feel they've been given quite a rough ride on here.",3

The accumulator in question was based on ‘both teams to score’ and this game had already got to 1-1 and was moved to ‘settled’. However, when a team scored again making it 2-1 it was moved from ‘settled’ and remained suspended for the rest of the match.  Ridiculous!Skybet state they can’t guarantee Cash Out services and were unwilling to refund my stake.

Sky Bet have not honoured this agreement and have stolen all the players and affiliate earnings from over 12 years. As from October 2017 Sky Bet will be keeping all the money affiliates used to earn on a monthly basis for themselves. Some affiliates were earnings hundreds of thousands each year from Sky Bet alone, this has been stolen and Sky Bet will be keeping this from now on.

2017-09-17,My issue is with sky bet cash out .yesterday I had a ten fold accumulator on the football  with 9 out of ten games correct. It was getting to the final minutes of the games with  no change if the tenth game had gone my way I would have been in for a win of £1200 so with one goal I would have had a good win as it did not look like happening I decided to cash out as I did there was a goal in one game which would not have effected the bet and as I pressed cash out it was suspended . No I have had plenty of bets on these and cash out comes back up after the score is updated but with minutes left of games yesterday it did not therefore leaving me unable to press cashout again . There we no reason for this to happen and looks like sky can see you trying to cashout and delay this.Also cashout is suspended at times when there are no goals in matches.This does not happen with other bookmakers.UNETHICAL!!!!!!! Sky seem to be stretching the rules to the limit.I for one will be taking my business elsewhere in future.,1

2017-09-06,I always bet on football accumulators but I've noticed that some of the games the odds don't add up. If you don't know what you're doing be very careful as they place some games at low odds even though it's got no chance of winning to make you think it's a dead cert.  I closed my account last year because of this. I have recently been in touch with tsa to get this sorted out. Biggest rip off I've ever come across. If you are with this site I strongly advise you to close your account and go elsewhere. Fuking idiots.,1

2017-08-14,"Awful treatment of loyal customers. Been with skybet for at least 8 years (as I have been with 3 other online bookmakers) and received an email today stating:Important Service Announcement After a recent review by our trading team, it has been decided that this account requires tighter liability management. Unfortunately this means the account will no longer be eligible for any of our free bet promotions (including Sky Bet Club and Money Back refunds). In addition, from this point forward any bets placed will no longer apply for Best Odds Guaranteed and will be settled at the price option taken upon placement. Been casual gambling with them for that long, never really winning anything big and they do this after a few wins totting up to about £400. Probably minus a heck of a lot more than that over the years!!! No explanation after contacting; all they could say was the traders decision is final and cannot be reversed. Oh, great show of loyalty to someone who has barely missed a skybet club of betting £25 per week!!! So I said to cancel my account, which they agreed to do immediately. However, look back and I'm still on there (must have thought I was bluffing). So go back to live chat and demand my account closure, which has now happened thankfully. I don't want to give business to a company that treats long standing loyal customers this way. I don't think they grasp how many online betting companies there are. Silly way to treat a good customer. I'm no professional gambler, I just must have won a few bets too close together. If you ever want to win anything (even after many years of not!!!!) avoid skybet like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!",1

In reality, i'm just voicing my opinion and feel the urge to get my word across, but by shutting my account i feel it's for the best, i will now join a real site. it may be a blessing actually. 1. The poker is all a big setup,  i do not know how there is still at it's peak 2300 players.2. virtual sports is just another rigged software in action. just play it, you will understand. ( you will get a rare win to make you feel good, and keep playing, but overall, just watch! ) you will understand.3. RNG and regulations and fairness is all a lie, somehow, there is some corruption going on. and no it's not because i'm ''tinfoil'', i'm just awake and can see a scam. it's not that hard really to see how rigged these online sites are, but sky takes the mick. They won't even let me just have sports betting, i agreed they have reason to close poker and games, because this is my main complain.But...like i stated in the emails, one day your time will be up, you will be exposed for what you really are. thanks for shutting my account just as i had nearly built my bonus builder, and had a 5 freebet. great timing eh?",1
2017-07-16,Can't really believe the bad reviews here as I've had no problems with Skybet at all in the past. If anything they've got better recently introducing several promotions that give opportunities for money back when losing as well as their loyalty scheme rewarding you with a free £5 bet a week when betting £25.Admittedly I'm not a big bettor and haven't been barred by them or had a dispute with them as some people have. Nor had any problems with their website being slow or complicated. They quite often offer the best odds when compared on Oddschecker so for a small scale punter I would say they're one of the best bookies around at the moment,5
2017-07-11,"I don't usually make reviews, but I had to for Skybet. It is probably the worst betting site for in play tennis bets. I cant understand how they are so bad. I can only assume the other departments must be doing so well that they do not care.Placing a bet in quick speed on an inplay match is the slowest thing in the world. Then there is hardly any cash out for any of their in play bets. And finally, the amount of times I placed a bet only for it to tell me a minute later that the bet was no placed is unacceptable. For any in play tennis betters out there, you know how much can change in a minute of tennis.

This event wasn't live on live score and at that time never thought to take a screenshot so I went online placed the name of the teams and William hill was playing the same game, it was at 86' minute. I would never had placed that bet if it was on 82' min in the first place as the stats showed pdx was smashing it. PDX scored at 93' of the original time called sky bet to be told they don't take liability for any ""glitches"" as it is on their terms and conditions.

A glitch in their system and they are not liable as their in play bets are there as a guide?  That's just silly.",3
2017-06-11,Terrible company. Once you start winning you are banned or heavily restricted with them! SkyBet should lose their license to be a UK bookmaker as they clearly are not one!

I have tried and tried to tell them but it does not make any difference. When you do get in and are using a phone or tablet (most people use them nowadays)  the page jumps and then jumps and then jumps yet again. It is a dreadful site!Pay no attention to their TV advert about how good their site is.Worst browser to get in is Chrome because it takes so long to load.Firefox is better but still poor. I find Penguin is the best browser but it takes a while to learn how to use it with Skybet. Best is to go elsewhere.,1
2017-05-14,"SkyBet is not the greatest bookies ever but these reviews I've read are way too harsh in my opinion. If you don't place crazy bets and are savvy with your money you can actually make really good returns on the site, especially due to SkyBet's PriceBoost and RequestaBet, and especially if people just researched a little about the football match they are betting on for example. I won £30 off of a £5 free bet just by looking at the stats of Real madrid and Juventus ahead of their CL game. A fluke you say? I then put some of that money on Fabio getting a YC against Chelsea and guess what? He gets a yellow card because I researched before hand. I know I wont win money every time basing my betting off stats but I am winning a hell of a lot more if I didn't, and I know that as a fact as I have tried blind betting before to not much avail.As my thoughts on customer service, I agree that there should be improvents such as the waiting time, but when you are eventually put through to someone on the site they are normally helpful. Also I agree that at times their connection can be really poor by just dropping out completley or stuck loading something forever until eventually the site crashes. The cash out system is not actually broken as many believe. I found out by chance that there is actually a 3-5 second TV broadcast delay from live sports and that SkyBet in fact are the ones who are completely up to date on live results. So If you think the cash out shouldn't be closed as nothing has happend in the sport, it should because it probably has and you will see what has happend seconds later.Anyway this is all I wanted to say, just play the system and you will be more than fine :). It is not Skybet's fault if people gamble stupid amounts of money on silly bets, don't read the terms and conditions, and then expect something back because they now feel self-entitled as they have suddenly developed common sense.The End.",3

2017-03-11,"Skybet Cashout is a total rip off, I specifically tailored my bet to be able to use the cash out option as advertised, including some obscure teams i wouldn't usually bet on, just so the option would be available. To my dismay it turns out they will ""suspend"" a random match in your bet if it looks like you may be able to cash out for a decent amount. The match WILL NOT really be suspended, they will happily take a bet on it but it WILL stop you from cashing out.In my case it was suspended for approx 20mins until seconds after another team scored making my bet lose. This practice is covered as their terms state ""We reserve the right to withdraw the functionality in line with our internal trading risk policies."" These risks evidently include someone's 38-1 bet still being in-play at 70mins!Below is part of the transcript from the chat session of me trying to find out what the reason was after being directed to the cashout help section of their site.[07:19:34 PM]D********: the market wasnt suspennded, i logged out,cleared data and restarted the pc, there were approx 15 mins left, all were in play bets.

I'm with sky broadband also and the signal is perfectly fine, anyway I reload the game and it re spins the last spin only this time it's not my chosen number and I won nothing. After contacting their online chat to gain my winnings that i played for and won rightfully they expect me to remember the exact number of which the spin was and time of the spin! I then asked if they could not look up the time I had to re open the game and apparently they can't view that. I only received a £5 add on to my sky bet wallet, that's a big difference to what my winnings would of been.

2017-02-07,"I've used Skybet for a while now, maybe 5 years, however as ive learnt more about horse racing over the past 6 months I've started to become more successful and less stupid with my bets. After a few decent winners, and i'm talking maybe 3k profit, Skybet have limited my account and now follow my every move, its quite pathetic (after betting on a US horse race their odds instantly change after my bet its very funny, i take it as a slight compliment). I've now been limited to bets of £15 on odds of 3/1, imagine. Skybet is easily the most userfriendly betting website but this limiting of my account after a few wins is really quite ridiculous. I contacted customer service who informed me that their trading team had taken the decision and there was nothing i could do! They arent even decent enough to give me a REASON why my account has been limited! Do they actually believe i'm a professional gambler?? Pro gamblers make THOUSANDS/MILLIONS not hundreds of pounds! Very disappointing and now will be leaving to Ladbrokes as a result. I have also spread the word about Skybet and this behaviour. So as a summary, if you want to bet and WIN, stay away.",3
2017-02-05,"I completely understand that roulette is a game of chance and luck, however, I have never experienced anything like sky roulette. 1 odd number in 22 spins? Moreover, 2 numbers between 1-18 in 23 spins. I've also had runs of 17 evens, 15 reds, 16 blacks. Also had 18 runs of numbers between 19-36. Again, I do understand that roulette is a game of chance, but the way the numbers are generated genuinely seem to be ridiculous. I have used other online roulette services and never ever experienced anything like this at other online websites. Another issue to highlight is consecutive runs of numbers. 11 numbers from the top line in a row, with 3 coming up 3 times in a row, followed by 15 twice and 30 twice. Of course, sky will say that its just down to chance, but I would strongly suggest avoiding as it is not random or fun to play. Just glad I only bet with 20p's!!",1

I have found the casino, games including slots and virtual racing completely rigged. Example: virtual racing - lays out the odds of the race, shows form for each horse but deliberately makes the horse with good form lose everytime. I have never seen so many 20-1 plus winners (apart from when you back it) I think it is daylight Roberry. If you backed the favourite every race in horse racing in fairly sure you wouldn't lose everytime, that's the odds. I have backed 7 races in a row every favourite and EACH WAY and won £0. Tell me that is possible?Along with this I lost a significant amount on sky Vegas.

2016-12-30,"I agreed with the last review. I called them about their promotion having opted in and then played through £7228 on Worms Reloaded a slot machine game in their vegas section. I won roughly 40p in every £5 lost and ended up with £6040 when i took my money out. I am aware of the loss and I'm not moaning as its part of the game to know when to stop and get out. However i always spin 100 times x 10 so i know based on the promo thats 5000 of the tickets they advertised. I called skybet and was told i had 1 ticket similar to the other reviewer. This 19mins before the draw at 6pm. I complain and after 20 mins wait im told i did have 3290 tickets and i had sadly won nothing in the draw. So 1) They lie. £1 SPIN = 1 TICKET and i read the t & c's. but they plucked a figure out i know to be a lie. I screen shot my history when shows £5 spins x 1000. So they are making up tickets2) They are a big company and maybe updating the spreadsheet they customer service guy told me about is clearly being done manually so they are missing circa 1700 tickets of mine and im not a mega betting fanatic so people spending more are more likely to be getting ripped off and i shudder to think if those betting hundreds even have 1 ticket to their name3) I read they have a king spin £1.6m jackpot up for grabs through 5 linked games and ""any one could win from spins as low as £1"". However in their advertising it specifically states in the stories section small print ""While we won’t be making more millionaires"" (skyvegas dot com/promotions/game-of-the-month) SO THEY ARE FALSE ADVERTISING!4) I agree with the other review. That use them just for betting or horses or sports. DONT use this games section. Its a sham and used for advertising. ALL the winners won from £1 spins or less. SO DONT spend more than £1 per spin as they target these and not those that spend more.I am happy with my level of gambling i offset my use of skyvegas with my big sports betting wins however i dont want people thinking their skyvegas section is a route to winning anything other than misleading jargon.My one star is because skyvegas is an unacceptable experience. Their a sham behind the scenes and lie which i think i unreasonable in fair gaming. They were not rude, just quite childish in making up ticket numbers simply because they didnt have the answer.",1
2016-12-29,"The customer service people don't seem to have much control. They log the £1m payout promos on an excel sheet manually which means when they say £1 = 1 ticket into a promo then you need to chase and ask them as I played through £136k in 2 weeks of the 2016 promo and they allocated 1 ticket. When I called they said ""oh sorry they need to log it on an excel spreadsheet"". I asked how do you chose the winners then... ""we just chose a few"". That isn't impartial or fair! The gambling commission should look into them. However they base their servers outside uk so despite their advert they ARE NOT regulated and cannot be held to account! Scam merchants. Oh and for my £136k I got a ""sorry it must have been overlooked""! And £5 free bet. £136k = £5P.s they just instructed I won nothing in the promo. When I queried how many tickets I had entered the response... 1.... I called and was told 9782 tickets but a technical glitch caused an oversight but I wouldn't be entered for the next day.... this even though we both know they only update an excel spreadsheet so ""we can't"" should be ""we can't be bothered"".Don't use these people for promos or anything a human is involved. They must have no one capable. This isn't a rant at the site as betting is good on the app but they can't be trusted with auctioning anything. Use for just the skybet. Don't use for promosI will use them but only for horse racing now. Bet365 everything else",1

When I tried to access my account I couldn't remember my username so the account was suspended. I contacted them in August to get it reopened. I was given my username and then was told I had to send some photo ID and a bank statement to reactivate the account which I did. Last weekend (10th Dec) I tried to access the account again as I hadnt heard anything, it was still suspended. I contacted them again and was told the account was not going to be reinstated and this was a business decision. I asked for a refund of what was left in and was told there was nothing in the account so I asked for a copy of the transactions. When I received the list I found that the account had actually been closed in June and the credit balance was just taken by Skybet. I asked why I had been asked to supply sensitive information unnecessarily when the account was already closed and as yet I haven't had a satisfactory answer. My son suggested that he opened an account and I could use it to do the Channel 4 pick 6 as it didn't cost anything. He used my card details as he doesn't have a bank account and they've suspended his account too. Fortunately I don't have a gambling addiction and have suggested to them that maybe they won't reopen my account as I don't spend enough. I'm still waiting for a satisfactory reply plus my son has requested a refund of the minimal amount he paid to open his account.

2016-12-03,"I have been betting with skybet for 2years now and have never experienced a problem with them up until now.  I am a professional gambler and have won tens of thousands of pounds with many companies. I have recently been on a good for me with skybet and have been withdrawing a lot of my winnings however I made a withdrawal on 10th November for £15,000 the agent on the phone told me this was fine and it would take 3 to 5 days before it would be in my account. My skybet balance at this stage was now £0,00. 5 days later I received a call from skybet from a man called matt at the Kyc team who reversed my withdrawal and  was extremely rude and was asking me a lot of personal questions he then requested I send him documentation to show how I fund my gambling, I sent in proof of winnings from betting shops along with the contract from where I sold my car wash I was told they would get back to me. A week later I received an email saying it had been passed up to a senior member of there team and I would have a response back within 7days as to the outcome it has now been 2weeks and I still have no word from them. When I call up and ask to speak to a manager I am told that they will not put there manager on the phone, I have asked to make a complaint to which I am told I am not allowed to complain until they make a decision. I have told them that the seven days has long expired to which they now tell me they are still looking into this and will get back to me when they decide too. I don't think it's fair how I am treated, it's very convenient that a week before my winnings I was losing a lot of money and they didn't question anything then but now it comes to paying out they make things extremely difficult. Skybet have my  £15,000 and have suspended my account, I simply want my money back so I can go to another company that know how to treat there customers. This behaviour is totally unexceptable and I think companies with such a big name should act more appropriate. Everything I contact them I am told I can not complain and I must just wait for them  to decide to call me back.

The point been that the website DID crash when I was using the cashout service but it didn't just crash on one device but on two.but it wasn't just the cashout part. it wouldn't let me reload anything or go back into the main home screen of my skybet account . Through out the whole 90 mins of my football bets I was having problems it wouldn't let me do anything I tried everything restarting my devices,clearing my browsing history and so on but nothing. Through the evening I noticed that a few of my bets were winning so my cash out was getting to a stage where I wanted to cash out but because of the shambolic service I couldn't do this .it worked for a small period of time and when I say small period like less than 30 seconds but not every time did it work .this is why I notiched the cash out was going to go up the ball icons was turning green when it did work for that small time frame but every time i scrolled down or up it just froze .The same thing happened not so long back and a time before that . So three times this has happened . Now I'm not one to even be remotely botherd about these things but tonight just topped it off for me . Why am I spending my hard earned money when I'm not getting the full services . And then when I questioned it to a help assistant on the online chat she told me the website has been fine derrr she's obviously going to say that . Further more I explained my situation to which she replied cash out isn't always guaranteed which I get that but I was trying to tell her that the whole thing was freezing it wouldn't let me do nothing on two devices one connected to WiFi and one connected to my mobile network which both was connected and working fine.I tried telling her it was the site that was not working properly but nothing. I had the potential to make some profit this evening but because of the shoddy service I've been shafted . Like I've said normally I'm not one to be botherd or even waste my time in writing a review but after what I've experienced I have to say something .if your reading this and you want my advice stay well clear of sky bet they are absolutely useless I've been a customer for years and I'm telling you now I will be taking allllllll my hard earned money and taking it somewhere else . Because let's face it there is other company's out there that are better than these jokers . I just hope the one I choose isn't in partnership with skybet . I will do my research before hand so that they never see my money ever again . If I could delete my account then I would but I could only suspend it for 5 years . Finally if there was a no star option then I think you can guess the next part . STAY CLEAR of sky bet people ..... Sorry for the punctuation and spelling if they are any .",1
2016-11-17,"My partner Called sky bet last week to find out why his old account was suspended and they told him he had self excluded himself back in 2013 and could not rejoin yet.....this was accepted by him.A few days later i joined sky bet myself to play roulette, when joining i used my mother in laws maiden name which i am more than entitled to use and me and my partners joint email address along with our mobile number, I also used our user name we use for everything, i set up the account on my partners bank card with his permission until my new card had come through which i then would of added to my account.I played roulette and won just over £1200 to which i withdrew with no problem back onto my partners card.A few days later i played again with £200 and won over £3300 to which i did the same withdrew and put back on his card.A few hours later i went to go back onto my account and it come up suspended so i called sky bet to find out why??The told me they had to verify who i was and asked me to send throughPASSPORTDRIVING LICENCEPROOF OF ADDRESSMY PARTNERS BANK CARD DETAILSMY PARTNERS PASSPORTi sent this through within 10 mins of the call to sky bet customer services to which they told me that the money had been put back onto my skybet account and as soon as i had been verified the money could be sent to me using there withdrawal on sky bet website, ALL CALLS TO SKY BET WERE RECORDED BY MYSELF, the reason for this was there reviews state from many unhappy customers the same thing has happened to them and this is there way of getting out of paying people, quick to let you bet but don't want to pay out.They told me that after receiving my documents it would take 24-48hrs to resolve.....After 48hrs i called them back and they once again fobbed me off and said there was a back log and would need more time.24hrs later i called them back and they finally put me through to the security department where i spoke to a extremely rude member of there team who told me that i was basically lying and had opened the account for my partner to use, he also told me that i was lying about my mothers maiden name, weather i use the name micky mouse or use my partners mothers name makes no difference this account belongs to me. i told him i would be taking them to the small claims court to which he replied''good luck with that' GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKY!!!Now its £3300 not going to change my life but I'm in the process of taking them to the small claims court as of today, with all the recorded conversations and emails from sky bet.Stating in the phone call ''is my money safe and would i be getting it'' to which he replied''This is normal procedure and you will 100% get your fundsAt the end of the day everyone is entitled to join sky bet but beware this will happen to you as well, i have 4 friends that are also with sky bet and have had the same problems either on the horses or football or casinoYes your a big company sky and I'm a little fish but i have nothing to loose taking you to court, I'm going to the newspapers and pushing this as far as i can go, i have spoken to the sun newspaper today who would be more than happy doing a story on this PERHAPS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS LOOKING AT.If anyone else has had the same problems then i think this should be looked atSKY BET IS THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER DELT WITH AND THERE CUSTOMER CARE HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST I HAVE EVER DELT WITH IN MY LIFEJOIN AT YOUR OWN PERILOH THEY JUST GOT BACK TO ME WITH THIS RESPONSE Thank you, so yeah unfortunately this account will not be re-opened due to multiple reasonsit fails our policy of 3rd party users and also it is linked to another sky bet account which has a running self exclusion placed on itITS MY PARTNER WE HAVE THE SAME SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HOW THICK ARE YOU PEOPLE!!!!!!Update- ok I have the sun newspaper coming over on Monday for a interview and have just raised a claim with the small claims court will let u all knowIn response to your 3 months late reply sky It was not feed back for you it was to let other poor unsuspecting skybet customers know exactly how your company has double standards and treats its players!",1
2016-11-17,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced!!!Placed several bets yesterday and won over £1k. When I tried transferring MY winnings back into my wife's PayPal account (which I have deposited several hundred pounds on many occasions) to find out skybet had suspended my account due to fraudulent checks!!Not once when I was withdrawing money from my wife's PayPal account did they decide to do this check (been doing this for months) only when I tried putting money back from my skybet account (£1000) did they check and suspended me!!I am still waiting (5hrs later) for my account to be reinstated.Ludicrous is an understatement!!!I telephoned three times this morning and got the same reply when I asked to speak to a line manager or team leader - they are not available and if they were, they would only give you the same answer as me!!!They are great at taking your money.... Terrible at giving you it BACK!!!I will be taking my betting account elsewhereDisgusting way to treat customers!One unhappy winner!!",1
2016-11-14,"Opened an account with SkyBet just a month ago and placed 5 bets altogether. Really liked the £5 free bet every week, but received email today saying  'it has been decided that this account requires tighter liability management. Unfortunately this means the account will no longer be eligible for any of our free bet promotions (including Sky Bet Club and Money Back refunds)'. What a lot of rubbish! Word of advice - if you don't want people to use the promotions don't offer any. Waste of time.",1
2016-10-30,"Had a skybet account for years. Unfortunately lost a debit card linked to the account recently so as soon as I got my new card I attached it to the account.Requested a withdrawal from a small amount of winnings and skybet would only pay my winnings onto the expired card. Skybet have no problem taking deposits off of my new card but they can't put any winnings onto the new card. They then decided to suspend my account due to possible fraud measures. They want a copy of the old card to re-instate my account. The card which I don't have any more. Shocking service. Tried to sort out online and couldn't. What a way to treat customers. Once this is resolved if it actually does get resolved, they have lost me as a customer. Not that that seem at all bothered. Awful service.",1
2016-10-27,Customer services staff have a far too sarcastic and blunt approach.,1
2016-10-22,"Great site, awesome experience.",5
2016-10-20,Easy to use and navigate a bit awkward on mobile but other than that all good.,4
2016-09-26,Everything fine while you are losing but as soon as you win a few or stop putting money in every week your out first they stop your free bets then they stop the promotion then the price boost then they don't even give you best odds guaranteed bog when you phone up and ask why they tell you it's not our department and you can't question why and do you want to close your account. If you don't ever win it's fine but don't start winning what ever you do.my advice go elsewhere don't be enticed by false promises and as for the reply below tried that what a waste off time they only  put that reply for show nothing happens when you complain.,1
2016-08-28,This company - CVC Capital Partners - are one of the worst I have ever had the experience of dealing with.,1
2016-08-28,"Placed a bet with sky bet which qualified for cash out, selections were winning with around 10mins remaining, offered an amount to cash out which I tried to take, whenever I pressed the button it said ""sorry there was a problem, please try again"" tried about 30 times, none of the selections were suspended. Bet subsequently lost. Should not offer any amount and not let you take it",1
2016-08-14,Sky bet is a joke. Complete joke. I made my money and when i wanted to withdraw them said my card isnt available for withdrawls. Yet it works perfecty fine everywhere else and happily takes my money for deposits but not for withdrawls? They also give me an error when i click on add paypal account so ive got my money stuck with them and i cannot withdraw it. Never ever ever ever use this company. If you expect a fair betting company sky bet is the last place to go!!!,1
2016-08-12,I've used a lot of gambling websites and Sky Bet has to be the best by a long way!If you take out the bitterness from people that just happened to lose money - Sky Bet were really helpful when ever I've had a problem and there websites really user friendly. great site,5
2016-08-06,"My account was suspended after winning a bet. (Seems a recurring theme reading other reviews) The fault was caused by the Sky Bets app transferring my address incorrectly. Placing the county in the street name! Anyway even though Sky were at fault. They have requested ID, proof of address documents and a scanned copy of my debit card. Apparently they are protecting me from fraud! No real apology and suspending my account on the first day of the football season. The very day I wanted to use the soccer six app! Don't bother calling them or sending messages as its a waste of time. I spent two hours being messed about. Truly awful!",1
2016-08-03,not happy with customer service i had 6 bet running in my cash out i had 6 out of 6 bet winning a total of £36000 AND CASH OUTS OF OVER £1000 my next game which was on all 6 bets was shown on sky bet tracker as being available for cash out between AMERICA MINERO v GREMIO FBPA this game was taken off cash out saying CASH OUT UNAVAILABLE ON EVENTS THAT DONT OFFER LIVE BETTING ONCE EVENTS ARE RESULTED CASH OUT WILL BE AVAILABLE but when i went into live inplay betting the game was there but shown as AMERICA MINERO V GREMIO RS for myself and everyone else to bet on with cash out so how was it not live. to make things worse the game finished 0-0 i lost my chance of cash out and was told it was a third party error and gave me all the cash out terms and conditions rubbish. i am now looking into taking legal action as i wasnt provided a service i was entitled to and lost my chance to cash out money i had accumulated . whether its GREMIO FBPA or RS they are both the same team and still the same match and 100% LIVE previous to this i thought the site was good and easy to use and had no problems but this experience has left me angry and frustrated when i know im right and they have admitted it was a mistake but blame everyone else but themselves,2
2016-08-03,We all know how bad gambling can be..Sky have NO customer service when it CONSTANTLY messes up your bets . Small print and Terms and Conditions are the only bile that they spew at you.,1
2016-08-03,"I put a bet on a price boost at 15/8 and after looking at the betting slip after it had won it had changed to 13/8 and sky told me I had not selected price boost, but after reading sky will be the best prices on all races at goodwood on all favourites which it was. And bet 365 was offering 5/2 they have not budged. I am discussed how was treat with this... Do not use they are cons. Keith payne",1

When Stenson won we expected a credit of £2,800, but nothing came through to our account. We called the help line desk and were told that we didn't click the confirm button when placing the bet which  seems very strange when the £110 was taken out of our account. We will never use this site again.",1
2016-07-11,Terrible site. I left paddy power to give sky bet a go and it was a huge mistake. I spend up to 10grand a month on betting and receive a free £5 bet each week. Hardly loyal is it?aw well ther loss I spose if they looked after their customers better they would make even more money.back to paddy I go,1
2016-07-06,"Sky bet are incredibly quick regarding payouts, no other site does it within 24hrs, as most of my withdrawals have been done within this time frame.The cash out is respectively good 99% of the time.  But it always tends to attract unwanted issues when bets start to do well.  That is always a concern that lingers in my head when placing bets with decent returns.  but as a whole, Sky Bet are for me top of the list.  Good odds, good CS, good site with lots for everyone.  How can one complain in all honesty! More free bets for good customers like me maybe!?  I always get told they cannot issue them at will!  Shame sometimes, as it is nice to be rewarded for being loyal etc.May the new footy season have much fortune and lots of happy returns ))",4
2016-07-05,"I have been a regular and happy Sky Bet and Poker (mainly poker) customer for eight years. However I had a disappointing experience last week when I was not allowed to enter a Sky Poker tournament even though I thought I had qualified via a promotion run through Sky Bet. The live chat customer support did not give me a satisfactory answer and was adamant that I did not qualify, so I registered a complaint.The next day I received a call back from Harry in the complaints team and he calmly listened to my case and investigated my account in depth and quickly realised what the issue had been, which led me to missing out on the tournament. He compensated me for my loss on the spot and left me a happy and satisfied customer.Great service after the initial disappointment, thank you Harry. This was the first issue that I have had for several years and generally speaking the site has great promotions on betting and poker and pays out quickly on winning bets, I would highly recommend.",5
2016-07-03,"Absolute joke of a site and their customer service is not much better if I am honest. A bet was advertised as each team to have 4 corners and each team to get 20 booking points. So the corners come in italy get 20 booking points germany get 10 and another 10 in extra time. However nothing is paid out I ring the number off the site and they basically said all bets are settled in 90 minutes unless otherwise stated and I should just be aware of that. If i clicked on the help button I would see that its stated there. I'm sorry but if its settled in 90 minutes it should state it. Its not hard to add in 90 minutes so people can see clearly what it is they are betting on! And it should close the bet on the site after the 90 minutes if it ends in 90 minutes not leave it open in extra time, penalties until the game has finished. I should not have to click on help everytime I place a bet in my opinion that is false advertising leaving important information in the small print. I was a regular user but I think I'll take my business back to bet365 and william hiĺl now.",1

I rang skybet to ask why and they where rude, insinuated  that i was lying and asked if i had screen shot it. When i replied no as i didnt know it wasnt going to work when i accepted it and then it was gone he laughed and said theres nothing we can do then. There was no appology or offer of any kind of compensation and he repeatedly told me that this would simply not have happened but if it did it would only pay me the £5.18 anyway.What a complete con!!!

Once the score on one of the games changed, the cash out was suspended for the rest of the match - 50mins!! As you can imagine I lost the bet as I had no way to cash out to protect my bet!

2016-05-24,"I used to like the Skybet group of companies.They used to be an honest bunch when based outside of the UK. When they moved to Wellington Place in Leeds, they have just gone down the road of the dodgy casino operator, and if you don't read the smallprint carefully, you lose a lot of money.I get big bold emails stating"" Stake £60 and get £20 free!""Unfortunately, they place a x 20 wager requirement on the £80, meaning you have to play £1600 at least to cash out YOUR money.I've had constant glitches with the software, and Skybet refuse to return stake.  Staff can be rude and unhelpful, insinuating that we are ""Trying it on"".Unfortunately, Skybet are falling well behind other bookies, such as Betfair & Paddy Power, who I now prefer to use for a better experience.",2
2016-05-17,"I just got an email saying posting documents is not recommended as skybet may not receive them(no mention of this on website) According to the boards this is an ongoing problem. This seems to me to be indicative of fraud or incompetence on behalf of either postal worker or skybet worker,disappearing bank statements and passport copies is surely an urgent matter for the police.If this is an ongoing problem,as skybet implied it is ,surely they have a responsibility to report and rigorously investigate it,absolutely shocking attitude",1
2016-05-16,"As a punter, I would recommended using Sky Bet. If they decide to restrict you, they will only restrict the use of casino bonuses and a few other promotions in order to protect their liabilities. They do not limit the sportsbook section to pennies like most other bookmakers. They will let you place bets like normal. Most other bookmakers are quick to limit- SkyBet are not!!  I got limited by Coral because I managed to get good odds on a starting price and I committed the sacrilegious act of taking advantage of those particular odds- all because their dozy traders were too slow to react. F.U>>>>>> Coral!!!!Thankfully that kind of thing doesn't occur with Sky Bet. They give out a free fiver bet each and every week with the Sky Bet club and that's a nice bonus to receive.I had a few issues with their website on Saturdays during the football, and i would have awarded them 5 stars if I didn't have to mention that.",4
2016-04-12,I used to be a customer of skybet but that all changed yesterday. As usual i had spent more than £25 in a week and received my free bet of £5. I placed an ew acca on four horses Imshivalla won 9/2 Imperial prince won 8/1 whats up woody won 7/2 . Now after the first horse won i was offered £6.48 to cash out my bet then when the 2nd horse won i was offered £93.98 i thought about cashing out there and then but after listening to will hill racing radio and the guy's unanimously tipping whats up woody to win so i let it roll. He obliged at 7/2 ! I was ecstatic so i went back to the cash out page to cash out as i had no intention of letting   the bet run to the final horse Heezararity in the 4.50 at Windsor. If the first 3 had only placed i would have let it run. As i said i went to the cash out and for some reason cash out was suspended on my account and there was still 3 mins before the off ! How convenient was that for skybet ? Obviously i was furious and contacted them immediately. If anyone has had a problem with skybet then you will understand what i mean by trying to get blood out of a stone ! They didnt want to know. I asked why cash out was suspended ? I was told they dont have to give a reason ! Well if that is'nt skullduggery at its best i dont know what to say. These people have access to everyones account and they can do whatever want at the flick of a switch !! I had never encountered a problem with cashing out a bet on the horses before but then again my winnings where less than £200 this was 3 times that amount and it was also a free bet. I'm gutted but you know what it just makes you realise its a mugs game. I spent £400 + per month with skybet so in the long they have lost out. I won't bet another penny from here on in with any bookmaker online or in shop. I'll still go racing and bet on course but for me betting online or in shop is over. I just want people to made aware that anything can go wrong when you least expect it to especially with SKYBET !!,1

2016-03-21,"I was a loyal backer with SkyBet for 4 years but suddenly found from one of their chat agents that my account was limited...... meaning that I would no longer be eligible to receive Best Price Guaranteed, any bonuses, any free bets  and any other promotion.  This was out of the blue as I done nothing fraudulent and/or abused any promotion on offer. I was told it was a Business Analyst decision and my account requires tighter liability management. They also stated that it would not be overturned. I requested to speak to one of that team and Surprise, Surprise they don't deal with customers.  I found it ironic that I was sent; and I completed, a survey that set out what skybet should do for the Cheltenham festivel as being a loyal customer. I find out before the festival that I was not even allowed place a bet on the promotion of No Lose 1st race. Thanks for that SlyBet.  Overall, I found them easy to deal with and one of the better betting sites but please do not plan to win much money as they'll limit you to the point of prehistoric betting rules with slapped on restrictions.

Great offer so placed bets on all 4 of the1st race for the 4 day meeting (BTW not best odds on offer at the time but tempted by free bet). After 1st day no free bet showing in account so called Skybet and advisor told me i was not eligible for offer. Asked why and was given no tangible answer so asked for manager, adviser put me on hold, told me no manager available but i would be contacted within 72 hours!

2016-02-08,"They have removed the football betting line over/under X amount of goals before Y time (example, under/over 0.5 goals at 9:59 minutes). I'm very disappointed at this as this was a unique line available only on sky bet, and I think it is a step backwards by sky bet in removing it. why offer it and then remove it? Very poor service. I questioned sky bet on why it had been removed and their reasoning was, ""it appears some games were booked on the wrong templates with our 3rd party rather than it being a conscious decision to remove them. So unfortunately we wont be offering them in future."" Why do these specific games affect every game, why can't they just learn from this and offer the betting line with the correct templates in the future instead of completely removing it? Therefor I will no longer be using sky bet in the future and deciding to move to another betting company.",2

2016-02-04,can you verify your age? yes I'm 45 here are my documents....time passes went to log In cant...contacted them..can you verify your age? yes I'm 45 here are my documents...so on and so on...,1
2016-01-30,"My step-daughter today placed a £1 bet on a 7 fold accumulator, the potential winnings were £36 odd. After 84 / 85 mins all the teams she chose were winning. She decided to cash out for £24 and a few pence. You have to confirm your cash out, and get a cash out confirmed message. She got this.Within 2 minutes 2 of the teams she had to win conceded. Lucky girl.... Not. After the games had finished she checked her account and it hadn't been credited. After 30 minutes trying to get through she spoke to an adivsor who just said haven't got it being cashed out at this end, nothing I can do. I then spoke to the advisor who couldn't have shown less interest if he tried.. Oliver Bro... ( he wouldn't give his surname and apparently another Oliver who's surname begins Br... Also works there! )He wanted proof! How? The bet said confirmed! I asked to speak to a manager and after being on hold for an age, he said a manager would call within 24, I'd be surprised if she gets a call. We will both be closing our account. As a point of interest, Skybet is not actually part of Sky, they just use their branding! I'll be letting Sky know how this company operates. Oliver also told me there was a long queue of complaints so I'd have to wait... Says it all! Tried to go to cash out help on the app, and surprise surprise, "" we are experiencing a high number enquiries. This service is currently unavailable. "" so how many others did the same bet? Bad service and a rip off, albeit for only £24 quid.",1
2016-01-26,Every now and again they will give you a matched bet either £5 or £10 in my case which isn't bad but there promotions are always same they don't offer acca insurance or anything just loyalty bonus even with that you have to spend £25 to get £5 and there football odds as very average,3
2015-12-20,"Ok so I bet around £100 after signing up with my driving licence for there proof. I win £1400 and try to withdraw £1200 so they froze my account and put me on to there fraud squad!? After jumping through many hoops they finally paid me. I said why allow me to bet and win for 6 hours before making me proof my in innoncence they said its due to regulations so I thought bit shady but ok. Now today 4 weeks on, 20th December 2015 I bet £200 for Barcelona to win. I cashed the bet out and won around £2300. 2 hours later sky cancelled my bet and said they got the odds wrong. After many emails and phone calls even called them out on Twitter if you check there Twitter feed for around 10pm you can see my tweets about them ripping me off. They basically said its there right to cancel any bets. So honestly do not trust this site. I used a betting site before that I know realise was pretty fair because I never had these issues. I've emailed a national paper and the independent betting assosiation people ibas to try get this resolved and will see how it pans out. Might even contact a lawyer. Do not use unless you lose!",1

2022-12-20,The poorest bookmaker in England I put £300 bet on ACCA one leg left I cashed in £4050 last leg lost . So I go back to shop Norwich next too five guys the staff call me a cheat to my face for using cash out so I complain to blarnie boy power over a week ago and he did sweet f a about it . So seriously I would advise using Betfred if you live in England as they are much better in every avenue polite not rude pay you out big wins like £10000 so when blarney power loses a bet he calls his customers a cheat and does nt even investigate the serious issue .,1
2022-12-27,If you are like me you try different companies beware. Paddy power is the worst. Opening offer promotion bet £10 get £30 free didn't show on my phone.after trying chat for ages got credited £5. Then tried laptop and it was totally different to phone. Offer showed. Now can't use offer as they can't change it until 7 days meaning I lost it.  Beware as if you take up these offers they didn't show or work on my phone(new Google 6) and you can spend £10 and get nothing back,1
2023-01-01,They give you a couple of wins on your first few deposits and then you only ever win very small amounts after like 68p or £1.44. I was £800 up but then since that I’ve spent a further £400 and won nothing bigger that the small amounts mentioned above.,1

I spoke to a manager named Kelly, and said Id like to spend the money on my cash card. Apparently this was a serious offence, so she gave me a suspension. I then receive an email a few days later saying I've been permanently banned. When I digged for the reason, they told me they were concerned that I wanted to spend my own money 🤣 absolute joke of a service. Hopefully if we all pull together we can get their license revoked. Will be reporting them to the gambling comission.",1
2022-12-15,Paddy Power is one of the better gambling sites and generally I am happy with it. My one complaint is that once you place a bet the odds change and you get no chance to reconsider if you still want to continue with the bet. They used to tell you the 'odds are changing do you wish to continue' but this does not happen any more.,2

I got a call back from the police to say because its a small amount they cannot investigate it. I called paddy power and this guy I spoke to from customer service was useless and talking to me about GDPR they cannot investigate it. It makes me suspicious that paddy power don't secure bets properly in there system. As an honest and genuine punter I think its ridicule that they have had this escalate for £10.23.

I’ve had bets place with old/wrong odds from before goals have happened. They haven’t fixed the bet with the longer odds that were supposed to be on there. I’ve had 2 bets in the last 2 days that they have not honoured or paid my winnings for. Do not use this company. I’d advise people not to gamble to much anyway but if you do steer clear of paddy power they are scum who are breaking regulations and have a support system that is just for show. Absolute scum. The only good thing about them is their promotions but the way they treat customers is so bad that I’ll take worse odds and less options somewhere else from now on. The drawn out chore that is getting 1 response from support every 20Minutes  is just to long and never worth it. You stop looking at your phone or your phone locks and your back off the page again.

2022-12-18,Corruption of the highest level has been happening since Betfair and Paddy Power merged in 2016 its not even a close call it is outright theft pure and simple and needs to be exposed.Betfair used to be a top rate Betting Exchange and a top rate company but since the merger with Paddy Power they have been stealing millions and millions of pounds off their loyal customers and it needs to be stopped now.Paddy Power(I have never had an account with them but I know all about their reputation especially in the Casino)run the Sportsbook and Casino arm of Betfair and they are literally defrauding and taking as much money off their customers as possible its absolute blatant theft with no consequences.RTP means nothing to Paddy Power they treat their customers with utter contempt like cash cows the Gambling Commission know all about their antics but do nothing because they have vested interests the police wanted to bring criminal charges against them years ago but were told not to by the Home Office so nothing is ever done they believe they are untouchable.My advice and it is serious advice is do not under any circumstances play in any Casino that is linked to Paddy Power because they are running a fraudulant operation and you can and will go thousands and thousands of spins without a thing without any bonuses.In my experience you can easily put thousands of pounds through any Casino that is linked to Paddy Power I estimated the RTP to be about 16% but in all reality it is probably under 10% you will always hit what you want on the previous spin or the spin after when it doesn't matter but never on the spin you want.Paddy Power need to be put out of business asap or people need to stop betting with them just read the thousands of negative reviews about this outfit they are a laughing stock in the betting community but its no laughing matter what they are doing and they don't care one bit so PLEASE take your money elsewhere(because believe me you will enjoy it more) and do NOT put a penny more through they're Casino as this shady and fraudulant company need their license revoked and to be put out of business in my view as soon as possible.,1
2022-09-06,"Thieves comes to mind when you see see or hear Paddy Power.Opened account, deposited £10 and soon after, PP suspended my account citing to check email for additional documentation.Nothing too terrible at this point as its fairly normal practice for betting companies -  uploaded documents required straight away but...Nothing for weeks on end with live chat simply saying check emails.Thankfully it is a small amount - again something I always do to ensure everything is legit and working before depositing more.At this point, they have my full ID and money for now almost 3 weeks.Just before posting this,  I thought I would give them once more chance :""They have confirmed that your documents and case are pending at their department.They will handle them as they coming into their queue and will get back to you on your email once they have feedback.I'm sorry, but we don't have a timeframe for when they can get back to you.""So literally, this could be an unlimited time - My advice to you is NOT to deal with Paddy Power.Don't open an account and if you really want to, then open with the smallest deposit amount you can - but be prepared to wait a long time before you can use it.All the opening offers that were there have expired/gone - maybe this is the whole point?Potentially what they might be doing is keeping peoples money as long as they can in holding maybe to earn interest and then refund / close accounts?House always wins after-all.Then again, I can't even get them to refund me the deposited amount so who knows.I am now having to go through the banks claw-back process in getting it back",1

2023-01-08,"Where do I start with Paddy Power.When I first joined Paddy it was great, throwing all sorts of promotions at me and giving me decent cash outs on acca's and free bets as goodwill gestures. Then it all changed.I started to notice after winning a few big bets for small stakes that Paddy would freeze my football Acca's and when I eventually got through to a human on the useless customer service ""message us"" option the reply I got was... We're experiencing a technical issue ( Every game ? ) or cash out isn't a guaranteed service ( then why offer it ? ).When I would call them out on this with screenshots they problem was sorted a few minutes later even though there were technical issues. The freeze outs just got worse. Whole games were frozen out, if all ticks were green and one or two games to go while in play it would say under that game.... "" Starting soon! I would have to check on other sites and if the team I chose which were winning fall behind and there's maybe 10 minutes to go ... Paddy mysteriously starts working again with a cash out of maybe £10 when it should have been way up in the hundreds! I also noticed certain options in my bet builders had been removed.When playing their slots I won back a fair amount over a period of time with again small stakes but then the games started to glitch and freeze and even during the drop of jackpots the app would switch off and I'd have to sign back in but by that point the jackpot was won.The biggest upset,shock and confusing experience of all had to be the "" Paddy Pick 5 "". I chose 5 horses back during Cheltenham in 2022 and forgot all about it. While in work I noticed an email come through from "" Racing TV"" . I checked the email as I'd never received one from them during my time on Paddy Power and while I've played the "" Pick 5"". The email said the usual stuff about the game and at the bottom... could you be a winner! So I tapped on the icon.... To my amazement it said... "" Congratulations Paddy will be in touch, you are one of the 5 lucky winners of a shared prize of 100k! 20k is your prize money!I couldn't believe it, so I took a screenshot. I emailed"" Racing TV "" and never received a reply, so I emailed ""Paddy Power"" and never received a reply. I then went through the"" Paddy Power "" message option and after 5 or 10 minutes arguing with a bot I finally got through to a human. I explained the email and sent screenshots and the reply I got was... These are just generic emails! I replied... A generic email to tell me I won 20k? Surely you've got that wrong? Plus this is the first email I've ever received regarding "" Pick 5 "" and I've played it a few times.The agent then asked if I could wait for a few minutes while they spoke to their manager. The agent returned with this reply. "" This must've been a communicational error! We apologize !I replied... I know I can get bad luck but this is like opening your PS5 box and finding tins of cat food in it's place!While talking away to the agent I was checking my emails and some how the email had changed from... Congratulations to... Are you a winner! Better luck next time!I screenshot that email and sent it to the agent which he had no response and offered me a free £5 bet.So technically "" Paddy Pick 5"" is a scam. I've the evidence to prove that according to them I won but some how they managed to change the email and tell me it was a communicational error and I was the unfortunate punter out of thousands upon thousands of people who entered the competition to receive this email!",1

2022-07-25,to be fair i have been with paddy for a few years now i used to play slots but found i would never win so i stopped that i bet on football and lotto had a good few wins never have not been paid.... in bank right away... as for the game side of things people that is down to you they are not holding a gun to you're head and making you bet so to the people on here saying they lost 800 and so on do not blame the bookmakers blame yourself for betting that amount its what you call chasing the win and 9 times out of ten you will loose ...in my head when i have a bet that money is gone but if i win happy days have fun with the bets and spend what you can afford,5

So we spoke a few times (with customer service team) and they couldn't help me so I st a timeframe for a call and they called me at a different time,I've made a complaint nothing changed so I stayed with my account blocked for 3 weeks and they did nothing so I decided to close my paddy power and betfair accounts.

2022-07-13,Woo look at the bad reviews paddy Power!!!Here's another!!!To keep it short and sweet!!I opened a account deposited £500 in total and played there European roulette game! I won just over £2050 and stopped. Great result for me!!I withdrew the 2k and did a £50 horse bet accumulator. Was out and was watching the racing forgot my phone so couldn't use the cash out facility. 1st won 2nd won and 3rd won.Bet paid close to 7k..I was over the moon thought 8.5 k days winnings was great.That's 2 I got home!!I went to withdraw my winnings.I couldn't log into my account it said please contact support. In which I did.They informed me that I had opened a account 12 years ago and only did one £50 bet!!So under there terms and conditions my new account I just opened was null and void!!My winnings where not paid to me!!No matter what I said or did they didn't budge!!Total corporate greed!!I will never use these crooks again.You can be guaranteed if I had have lost 8.5 k they wouldn't have refunded it.I can't even remember opening that 1st account!!So if you think you opened a account years ago and you have since opened a new 1. and you have lost alot your intitled to your money back.All I got was my original £500 deposit back. And to make it worse it took 5 days for it to arrive!!!Avoid paddy Power like the plague!!!,1

2022-07-11,"After being a loyal customer for years with PP,I am truly disgusted with the manner in which I have been treated..I have always used the faster pay visa withdrawrel method and true to form it is in my bank before I can even log in to online bankingHowever this time I went to withdraw this option wasn't available to meI was forced to give my bank account number and sort code I wasn't happy about that as they now had every bit of my personal banking detailsBut this was the only option to allow me to withdraw my money..I was told it was bank transfer and would be in my account within 3 to 5 working days..After checking a couple of days later the payment was returned to my PP accountSo after speaking with CS this was processed by the same method After another 5 days I contacted my bank and and they said PP had never sent the payment..After complaining again to CSThey said they would have to look into..Once again the balance shown again on my PP account..There is no contact number and this was tedious and time consuming having to repeat and explain the situation over and over again. I made a comment that I had made a commitment with the money I was expecting back and not having this had left me in difficulty to pay it..With that the advisor said she needed to suspend my account and I would have to wait for the safer gambling team to contact me..I was fuming with this as I did the sensible thing depositing what I could afford with the possibility of losing..so when I didn't lose it I withdrew..At no time did I tell her I was in difficulty because of my deposits..The safer gambling team is their own advisories not even an outside body.. They are still holding my money and not even bothered to contact me..They only suspended my account because I told them after such a mess I would be immediately closing my account once the money had been sent to me..Good tactics PPSo here is the situation They sill have my moneyNo contact from the safer gambling teamAccount still suspendedNo contact numberAccording to them I must be a gambling addict! Thank you PP for that...So the withdrawal is just £67And of course they Don't want to me to close my account as I could of bought a nice house for what I have contributed to this site .. again my choice I wasn't forced to deposit But to go through all this for just £67 is an absolute joke. And at no time had we been informed of the change with the withdrawrel methods Today I will be contacting the gaming commission about them and I have been told by a good source that PPs complaints have gone through the roof.. I hope they get a big fine to help them get real and treat the customers with some respect.. Are you listening Paddy Power!!",1

I don’t believe I will see my money back however if you got a betting slip which has a mistake with a winning bet make sure you just contact the support team on the phone straight away and don’t get help in shop. I had went to a paddy shop on 25/06/2022 which I placed a double and won however one game got voided. So I went to a paddy shop to try get that rectified so they took down the ticket number scanned it etc and said to me come back tomorrow and they will give me an answer with the head office the total amount is meant to be £157 but it was currently paying out £60 because one game was voided. So I went back with my ticket the next day and they said it had been cashed out and I was in shock how could my ticket be cashed out only me and the member of staff had the ticket. They then tell me it happened whilst I was in the shop at 16:09 and told me I cashed it and made a bet with it after but I have claimed this did not happen. I am very disappointed and feel like I have been robbed by a member of staff there I have asked them to look at footage but they said I need to contact police now cause of theft which means they won’t do nothing.

2022-06-13,"Gambling commission, where are you? This site is beyond corrupt, bonuses have clearly been removed, spins are clearly tampered with by your operators, and the rtp??? does not happen. i did a little test on the new eye of horus fortune spins, rtp 94% £40 on a 20p spin cycle £1.65 returned no bonus dead spins after dead spins. I've been with your casino for years,  Gaming history shows more corruption with countless dead spins exceeding over £20 before a single penny is returned.

2022-06-06,"Am an occasional user of the PP app placing bets for horse racing and golf. I placed three small bets on the Queen’s horses for the Derby about a month before the race to then hear the horses had been withdrawn from the race. I find it somewhat fraudulent that PP have kept my money, and treated the bets as non runners. Surely if the horses were withdrawn nearly a month before the race, PP has a moral duty to return the bets?On their website it declares these bets to be Future Racing Bets, and therefore they keep the bet, but now I know this, I am closing my account and withdrawing the small sum I have in my account. Not prepared to risk a pre race bet again!",1

Hidden deep in the terms & conditions, Apple Pay does not count.... but when you come to make the deposit, big massive Apple Pay logo filling the entire screen (could not see any other alternative options). So tricked into depositing via Apple Pay, which means the offer is null and void. You cannot talk to anyone on the phone and while some of the agents are pleasant (one was rude and cut me off from the chat!), they are reticent to follow their own complaints procedure and won't really escalate.Lesson learned by me.

2022-03-30,"Dear dear me. I have just become aware particular on non Uk racing bets forecasts don’t get regularly settled as forecasts instead it picks up and pays out on just the win only. I have only just picked this up. This means they haven’t settled a forecast bet correctly! So unless you see the race,which with foreign racing you often won’t you put your trust in Paddy Power to settle correctly -they clearly don’t! They expect you to contact them as they have this haphazard system ! Yes they have corrected my latest bet but I have done 100s of foreign forecast/tricast bets how many more have not been  settled correctly. Suggest everybody looks through their previous bets and contact Paddy Power to see if correct? I am not reassured at all. Surely the gambling commission should withdraw their license because of this. Scandalous. Update they said have difficulty settling Australian dogs so resulted in just paying out on the win odds ignoring any forecast /tricast. Fair enough if that was a one off but they continue to advertise odds for Australian dog racing on line and accepting forecast/tricasts a joke",1

Can i ask you to call the Commission 0121 230 666 and register a formal complaint. If you have screenshots of conversations that would be great. If you do not its OK as your factual account of your dealings/communication and their actions will be fine.( Please call them as this company can only be held accountable if you report it.Yesterday it hit home to me how serious this is.I contacted a person who placed a review.He won and tried to withdraw his winnings. They put barrier after barrier up . He still has not received his winnings after 3 months. He felt stupid.

2022-03-20,"Paddy Power has on many occasions breached Licence Condition 17 of the Gambling Commission's LCCP by suspending accounts right at the point of withdrawal (after they tell you your withdrawal is already being processed, in fact). In my experience, whilst trying to communicate with extremely rude, unresponsive, and unhelpful customer service agents as to why they would not allow me to withdraw my funds, I happened to mention something I planned to purchase with my winnings (nothing illegal or even wrong whatsoever). They then proceeded to give me a one-year ban because they didn't like what I was doing with my winnings! Unbelievable! The customer service agents will string you through lie after lie after lie, and then close the conversation on you when you call them out with evidence. They outline a ""complaints policy"" yet don't adhere to it, refusing to allow you to speak to management, or even acknowledging your complaint. I can't believe a company like this is still allowed to operate. The Gambling Commission is certainly due to an investigation into the practices behind Paddy Power and Betfair's, as from asking around, I know my case is not an isolated one.",1

Government really need to check this site, i can give 10000% they scamming us. It is not possible like that when spins win percantage over 80% :D Fck the paddy",1

2022-03-18,I just won the £1000 jackpot on Wonder Wheel and GUESS WHAT?! It SOMEHOW span again AFTER it stopped on the jackpot symbol!!!! I used to wonder if anybody ever won the big prize on Wonder Wheel and now I know…NOPE!! Don’t bother with PP or any of their rigged beyond belief games. If I could give them zero stars I would.,1
2022-03-16,"DO NOT USE PADDY POWER - RIP-OFF ALERT. I opened an online account with Paddy Power and they gave me a free £5 bet (only available on today's races at Cheltenham). So I used it, first ' claiming' the £5 Free Bert as instructed and then entering the £5 in the Free Bet box on their Mobile App. Of course it took the money from my deposit. I complained but they offered no explanation for the rip-off and refused to reverse the error. I have withdrawn the rest of my deposit and will close the account when the funds hopefully come back in 2-5 days (another rip-off, as they take the deposit instantly!). This is obviously a con, stay clear if you don't want to get ripped off!",1
2022-03-15,"I've just played Knight Rider slot on Paddy Power's site and I've come straight here to share my experience. I played £1 per spin and within 15 minutes was down by £160 with less than a dozen wins in that time and the vast majority of them less than the stake, 50p, 25p, 10p, you get the idea. I thought it might be like Eye of Horus where you rarely win but the feature gives big wins when it comes up, usually over £100 and sometimes even £600. I soon had my answer when the feature came up and I won 10 free spins and I thought I might win my money back. The result? £2.65 after 10 free spins. I carried on and to cut a long story short finally got the feature up again. This time I did much better. £11.65 after 10 free spins!!! It really is a bad slot and as the RTP figure is 96% I can only assume that it pays it all out in one go to some lucky person after a million spins or so. There really is no chance of making even a small profit from this slot when you're lucky if you get a 50p win after a £1 spin and if you do this will only happen every 30 spins or so. Not recommended.",1

Apparently this is the only number they have in the UK, but when I phoned I just got a message about not being able to place bets over the phone any longer and then it rang off.

Worst odds on market for football, bet builder odds are so pathetic and worst off all are their gaming services. Where every other service provides 10p per go gaming paddy's only has 12pm that has the same rewards as the 10p. Also learned the hard way majority of apps average a bonus win every 5 to 7pound spent. But paddy's u need spend 15 pound to hopefully get a bonus. Example I played big bass fish and spent £10 I got 2 scatters 9 times and not once got close to a 3rd inside those 9 times. Completely fixed service. Paddy does his own adds cus he is cheap worst of all he has cheek to run down sports men and women and teams all time online but yet he is fat mess who never achieved anything",1

It was just bad luck. £.50p per spin (same as before) 20 spins no wins. Not even a little win. So playing 40 spins with no wins how low has the bar been set??  Absolute rip off of a casino.

2022-02-08,To give credit were its due I would like to thank paddy Power for their brilliant customer service. They reply in a reasonable time. They do everything possible to help with any query I have had. I've been a customer only for about a year and if you play the games which are awesome you can actually make a decent return for your deposit. You will never make a fortune unless you hit the big jackpot but I can honestly say some days I deposit £10 and can withdraw 60-100. Sometimes you don't win especially if you don't withdraw your winnings lol but that's not the point the point is the games are fun and I enjoy playing them with the hope of one day winning big. I have a lot of betting accounts with online casinos and pp is by far the best and fairest. They pay out instantly. Give you plenty of bonuses and offers every week but like I've said most importantly the customer service is excellent.,5
2022-02-06,"I was surfing tonight. Came across the free spins offer. I’d already done these offers On a few sites. I signed up with Paddy Power. I clicked (Opt In) for the offer. Then I tried to use the free spins offer. My account was locked immediately. I went on the chat and spoke to an agent who said,” I had to upload identification”,I did with my licence. Thought everything was ok. The agent came back on an stated,” it needed more identification”,they could not verify my account with a legal form of identification which a full driving licence is. I’ve never had so much inconvenience and obtuse agents over a few free spins. They were very serious,you think I had robbed them the way they carried on. Needless to say I won’t be going on their site any time soon. I also stated to the agent I was not comfortable sending copies of all my identification over the internet,still did not budge. That was my very short and irritating experience with Paddy Power and their agents.",1

I spent exactly £100 playing a variety of slots on 20p bets and received nothing more than 80p max on a bonus.... If you're an experienced slots player you'll know how ridiculous that is.

2022-02-02,WORST SITE EVER! Did not get any new customer rewards so had to contact support and after 35 minutes of waiting they finally answered and transferred me to someone else (another 20 minute wait) then the guy took 20 minutes to look into the case. awful site,1
2022-02-02,"Update - Be conscious when on the customer service chat, all the chat agents can see all the scores and feedback left for them. I thought it would be confidential to managers only, had it confirmed off 2 of their supervisors that all staff can read your comments and feedback given about their staff. Couldn't believe it when I found outGone downhill a lot. I play bingo on Paddy Power and use the slots on the bingo section to gain reward points. I used to be on their VIP list 2 years ago but lost that status after only 2 months. I've always been in the rewards club and prior to being VIP level I was on Diamond level which was the one below VIP. I used to get around a £40 bonus each week and had my account manager who I could contact with any issues or concerns. Since their new tier levels come in I ended up being in tier 2 for a while as I cut back a bit on my playing, I've not just gone up to the highest tier possible which is tier 1, the customer service is still rubbish, useless chat system and to top it off when on tier 2 I used to get bonuses between £5 and £10 once or twice a week, since being on the higher tier they gave me a £2 bonus, I actually couldn't catch my breath, you get less for being higher up. I've asked what extra benefits you get in tier 1 compared to tier 2 and nobody can answer it because they don't know on the chat system. All their room page says tier 1 and 2 get the same benefits except for the weekly free room and end of month one is higher prize money. You only need 6,500 points for tier 2 and then it jumps up to 25,000 points needed to be to tier 1, the points difference required is quite big so you would think the benefits would be much better being on the higher tier, instead my bonus was less and the benefits seem the same as before. If I don't notice anything different over the next month then I will be taking my business elsewhere. Loyalty should go a long way, apparently not so far.",3

Having gone through the hassle of trying to establish the reasons for this, I was informed the account had been temporarily closed until I provided some personal information. Surely the correct way to deal with this would be in the first instance to inform you of the information they require, and if not provided then suspend the account! To simply suspend your account with no explanation or reason given is an appalling way to conduct business.Hence the reason why I have advised P/P,  I longer wish do business with them, have delated their app and have closed my account.

Fancy ads but shocking customer service, awful odds and the games are laughably in favour of the house. I rarely play slots but if I have a little win on the sports I might occasionally spend €10 or €20 on slots. Il do 10c spins and I've only ever got a bonus feature 3 or 4 times. Never won anything over a €5 in 3 years.  Like I said I rarely play the slots and games but when I do it'll be nothing but €20 10/20c spins and winning 1c or 2c per spin if I'm lucky😂😂. Also the cash out feature for sports is completely broken. You can have 2 selections won in a 4 fold accumaltor and 2 yet to kick off.  And the cashout value will be less than original stake... How the hell does that make sense? They will freeze your bets whenever they please. Or suspend markets before the event has even started. Sometimes they just refuse to let you place bets on certain markets for no reason at all. Try and place a bet for son heung to score anytime for Tottenham. You won't be able to because they refuse to offer this market with no explanation. They run promotions that never work and always seem to involve 'technical errors'. Free bets and offers never seem to get applied to your account. You have to contact customer service and normally wait between 30 mins to an hour to get it resolved whilst answering stupid questions. Just to get the free bets you qualified for rightly credited to your account. Then they have the nerve to call it a good will gesture. I can never normally be bothered to write reviews but the more people that know about this shoddy bookmaker and it's questionable practices the better.",1

Total bet was 40p and total win on the bonus round was 1pound - ridiculous- followed by another 25 dead spins winning absolutely nothing. The free daily slot machine thing is rubbish too. I’ve only ever won a 10p scratch card ha ha but most days I don’t even win anything.The slots payouts have been horrendous all year. The most I have withdrawn has been £30 and I have put it ten times that in the past 3 months alone! I dread to think how much I have lost there this year. Closing the account, they won’t get another penny out of me next year! Oh and the live chat facility is a farce because nobody bothers to answer. They don’t provide any email addresses for support or queries either.I agree with everyone else that this company seriously needs to be investigated as the slot machine payouts seem very low and far to many dead spins on all of them.",1

2021-12-03,Probably the worse bookmaker out there for restricting yours bets if you don't have a losing account. They only want people who lose money.

2021-11-12,"I have won a considerable amount of this app. I have won £500 jackpot, £400 jackpot of slingo Britain's got talent, £300 jackpot king on deal or no deal scratchcard, £200 on rainbow riches slingo, I've won £112 on vault cracker and £100 of fluffy favourites slingo. I do win quite a lot but find the paddy power rewards do not reflect the amount I deposit. I could deposit anything from £50-£100 a week and will not win 1p back from the free £5 bet. Never ever win on the daily spin either. You have to put in at least £30-£40 and play lots of different games not the same to win big. Advice to anyone who gambles and loses so much. DO NOT PLAY THE SAME GAME CONSTANTLY. Also I seem to find the higher the RTP (eg. 96.25% or 97%) you are winning literally pennies whereas a RTP of 92.8% and gambling about £15-£20 on the same game will then amount to a big win which in a sense is not very fair. And then you will lose what you win by depositing it to win another bonus or cash prize. Main thing is withdraw little bits at a time and it does add up! If the bonuses were better on paddy power rewards club I'd give this app a 4*",3

It took a long time for me to get them to delete both accounts and return my money. It was a long painful process. Then they email me to tell they have closed my account because I am a problem gambler supporting this with what I should do and how to behave.

The games run so laggy and slow and then crash and auto shut the app down, this tends to happen whenever the timer for daily bonus gets near so you can't win it. I also wanted to check the winnings so spent 380 quid playing on a single game, I unlocked 2 features and whenever they dropped, not very often the most money won was £3. The highest amount paid out was £7 at any point. So yes very unlucky to win as whenever hourly, daily jackpots are due they crash you out, and features basically get you sweet fa. Avoid gaming, but betting is fine.",1

I was at my lowest point in life and had bad thoughts. It wasn’t until a few days later when I became a little better,that I realised what I had one. I gambled over a £1000 on the slot machines. At the time not knowing what I was doing due to mental health. I was deviated as I had no money for the rest of the month for bills food etc. Made my mental health so bad I even thought about suicide. I don’t gamble often at all. Was doing it without realising.Got in touch with Paddy Power to explain my circumstances and what had happened due to my illness. Seriously they didn’t have a care in the world as long as they had there money. I enquired about may having a refund, explaining what happened and my condition. They didn’t care one bit. All they said is there’s help with gambling addiction. It’s not an addiction I said. My illness was the reason.anyways I managed to overcome my situation just but with no help of Paddy Power.

2021-10-07,"Horrible company. I bet loads and lose loads but they take the Michael with their prices before the off on horse races now. I’ve made a decision never to bet with them again. In addition after reading this it makes your blood boil. Ask yourself would you they have paid the difference in the bet back to the punter if the horse lost. Vile company .Punter sues Paddy Power over disputed £286,000 winning bet at WolverhamptonPaddy Power: bookmaker considers itself ""bound in honour"" to pay £28,600 to a punterPaddy Power: bookmaker considers itself ""bound in honour"" to pay £28,600 to a punterEdward Whitaker  Paddy Power are being sued by a punter after crediting his account with £286,000 for a winning bet, only to claw it back two days later on the grounds that he had originally wanted to place a much smaller bet.The dispute is expected to result in a High Court hearing at the end of this month, at which one of the issues to be put before the judge will be the fairness and legality of the 'error' rule commonly used by bookmakers, which has so often been the cause of complaint among punters denied a payout to which they believed they were entitled.James Longley backed Redemptive when she won at Wolverhampton in September 2019, phoning up Paddy Power to ask for £1,300 each-way at the 16-1 that was then on offer. The operator who took the call said she would seek authorisation from a trader, as the maximum stake for his account was £203.At this point, the operator mistakenly relayed the bet to a trader as a request for £13,000 each-way. The bet was approved and the operator relayed that information to Longley, who says he was happy to be allowed a much larger bet than the one he had sought.Longley's phone call was recorded and a transcript has been included in court documents from the defence, seen by the Racing Post. It shows the operator telling him: ""I got that cleared with a trader for you"" and adding: ""So that's going to be twenty-six thousand coming from [account name], is that correct?""Longley replied: ""Yeah, that's it, yeah"". The parties do not agree as to whether he had realised at this point that a much larger bet had been authorised, Paddy Power insisting he must have misheard, misunderstood or thought the operator had made a slip of the tongue.'An unfair contract term'Before the race started, Longley says he checked his account and noted that a stake of £26,000 had indeed been deducted from his available balance. The bookmakers argue that it was only at this point Longley realised he had been allowed a bet much larger than he had asked for, and that therefore there had been no true agreement between the parties as to the bet and it should be void in law.The claim document written on Longley's behalf states that ""no demand for repayment of the sum of £286,000 was made by the defendants"", the implication being it was taken back from his account with no prior indication that the bet was in dispute. Paddy Power's defence document admits Longley's assertion but calls it irrelevant because the firm's error clause ""permits the defendants to reclaim balance from the account"".That error clause is attacked by Longley's lawyers as ""an unfair contract term"", causing ""a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations"". They state that Paddy Power ""had the opportunity, on the one hand, to lay off the full amount of the bet accepted [£13,000 each-way] and thereby reduce its exposure to the bet while the claimant, thinking his bet had been accepted in full, has no similar right"".The lawyers assert that, while Paddy Power claim the right after the race to insist the stake was £2,600 rather than £26,000 and resettle the bet accordingly, Longley would have been unable to make the same unilateral reduction in stake if Redemptive had finished unplaced.Paddy Power's lawyers deny the clause is unfair and say the Gambling Commission's code of practice specifically envisages there will be situations in which a bookmaker may void a bet. They insist the firm ""have corrected and do correct errors which favour them, whenever the same occur, and will adduce evidence to that effect"".The firm views Longley's bet as a winner at £1,300 each-way and credited his account with £28,600 at the same time as clawing back the £286,000. Some of the arguments advanced on its behalf would mean, if correct, that it had no liability to pay anything, as the bet would be void but the defence document says the firm considers itself ""bound in honour"" to pay.",1

So I tried to withdraw this £5 in the form of a voucher. 5 minutes later I received an email from PP saying that my account is closed ""based on business ground""! I then contacted customer support to find out the reason behind this decision and whether they could reactivate my account so I could at least bet the £5.

What followed was two months of delays, lies and insulting, offensive messages from them. They began treating me like I had a gambling issue, though I only usually have a bet on the horses when they're on ITV or I'm having a rare day at the races and, to underline I have no 'problems' I have actually withdrawn more from my PP account than I have deposited this year yet they still kept my account suspended.They have now CLOSED it, even though I have four valid football bets still running and STILL have £90 on the cashcard pplus. The card has now expired. This means they are voiding four legitimate bets which will, almost certainly, gain returns, and KEEPING my money.To add further insult, they sent me links to help sites for people with gambling addictions?

2021-08-20,"Not gonna lie it's not the best, but at the same time not the worst site where I have played. Can tell 1 thing for sure 2x better than coral or Ladbrokes. referrerCode=W37C4R376",3
2021-08-19,"Terrible, terrible game site.  Luckily I only play low stakes slots, but this site gives you no value for money, just quickly drains anything you put in, no decent wins so you can play longer, it’s like it’s scared to let you get above your deposit in case you withdraw, you play with no hope, it gives you absolutely nothing, as I say I play low stakes 10p games mostly, but it gives you no time to enjoy it, just no wins, I play on sky Vegas normally and thought i’d give this a try, but was shocked by how bad a site it is, stay away from this site, it doesn’t even give you a random chance of winning, and will not let you win more than you deposit. I won’t play on it again. I don’t expect to win big on any slots, but I like to play on ones where there’s a chance of maybe getting back more than you deposited every now and then.  Absolutely no chance on Paddy power.",1
2021-08-18,Paddy Power is a fantastic app and sportsbook. The app is more user-friendly than some of the other competitor's apps. Keep it up!,4
2021-08-17,Absolute scam don’t put blood and tears into actually making a decent amount of money as 9/10 of the time you lose then get annoyed and go again and again and end up losing more and more so screw the company plz if your reading this don’t waste your time.,1
2021-08-16,"Never had any problems with them,great offers and winnings straight into your account.100 times better than Hills Coral's and Ladbrokes are a joke they restricted me to the casino and never laid me one bet on sports.Ladbrokes are not bookmaker's they're Imposters.",4

2021-08-14,"Pros - * Simple sign up process* Quick verification process * A good selection of live games, Poker, Slots, Bingo* An easy Withdrawal process* Instant withdrawal to Halifax debit cards(Up to £1000) within 10 seconds.* A responsible Gambling team that message as soon as a change in your gambling pattern occurs* Paddy Power instant cashout cardCons-* Live chat is slow* clicking on Live chat takes me to Betfair at certain times (Completely bizarre) * Bonuses offered to customers are far less than their competitors. Example I deposited £1000 and got free £5 following Monday from PaddyPower Rewards. Same deposit on 32Red got me a red envelope which gave me £70 no wager requirement cash which was instantly withdrawrable. Also was enough to trigger enough points to give me additional free £10, plus qualify me for free spins on games and upgrade my player status.* A deposit limit is applied to most accounts by PaddyPower. I earn £75k - £100k a year. My deposit limit is £1000 month. (Weird) At 32Red it's £2500 A month which is reasonable and they also are a responsible lender. * Other sites offer a larger selection of live games. Example - live Deal or no Deal (not the new one, that's a terrible game)* Other sites offer more recent selection of slots. Example - Coast to Coast slots* A low limit is applied to the withdrawal of your PaddyPower instant withdrawal card.Overall a good, decent and fair site, slightly lacking behind its more powerful competitors.3.75 / 5Well done Paddy 👌",3

2021-08-12,"A complete sham of a company. Don’t expect to have any value as a customer. Their chat facility is a waste of time and space. Nothing ever gets resolved and to top it all you are met with obnoxious, rude chat agents. They seek to absolve themselves of any responsibility and pass the buck back to you as customer. Just recently I made a deposit via paysafe. My balance with paysafe was duly debited however no such credit to my paddy power balance. I contacted the chat team who told me they were aware of the issue and that I could expect a resolution within 24/48 hours. Why so long considering I had receipts clearly displaying the nature of the transaction. Was told this was their top priority in terms of achieving a swift resolution. Swift meaning they would be withholding funds of mine for up to two days. Worse to follow, I contacted chat a few hours later who told me now they had decided it was a paysafe problem and therefore I needed to contact paysafe to get a refund. So effectively washing their hands of any responsibility and meaning extra time and effort to be expended by myself. Paysafe being an accepted payment method partner of Paddy Power. This partnership seems to work one way, pretend you are not a partner and have no responsibility as a partner when things go wrong. This is just one of many examples of situations I have encountered with Paddy Power. Don’t make the same mistake as me and avoid their services at all costs.",1

2021-08-08,"I would give paddy power no stars if I could, absolutely shocking the games are definitely not random like they say it’s impossible to win. I know you should stay within your limits and only gamble what you have but they will take it all without a care or a win, they literally take the fun out of gambling. It’s impossible to get through to a human to discuss anything, so poor. My advice would be don’t make the same mistakes and save your money believe me they don’t care about you and you will not win trust me!",1
2021-08-07,Gambled with paddy power for years and never had any problems until now. I made an each way bet in a race that was paying top 4 places and even wrote this on the slip. My horse came 4th and I’d had £50 each way and was due to win £200. When I went into the bookmakers to collect my winnings they told me it was a losing bet and they chose to only pay 3 places in the end even though it was 4 when I put it on. They said to give paddy power a call to dispute it which I did. They told me that the rules on the each way can be changed at any time and told me to escalate it to another person which I did to again be told no we won’t pay out? £100 is a lot of money to fork out in which I wouldn’t have bothered putting the bet on with paddy if I knew they weren’t paying top 4 and would have done it with someone like skybet who don’t change their rules mid race. An absolute joke and won’t be giving them anymore of my money!,1

However at the same time, my £10 weekly deposit limit came into effect.Call me suspicious but :P I think it would be pretty poor play if the two were related, and without them able to give me a reason...it makes me believe that it is, espectially considering they told me accounts are reviewed.

I asked her to please be polite and not to talk to me like that (long term customer who spends lots of money) Never again. she went on and on and on, wouldn't let me speak, talked over me, she said she would bow down for me if i wanted her to, praised her hands up and down, again patronising, called me sir in such a smart alec way, laughed, talked loudly to her colleague, do what you want, yes sir, yes sir, etc  she wouldn't let up.  She was so rude and embarrassed me in front of two customers. I was so upset but kept so calm, but she persisted and got worse;  to be spoken to like this was absolutely appalling; And have you tried making a complaint online to PP, good luck,  I will never use PP again, I was the only person of white ethnicity so I wonder if the verbal patronisation and constant laughing directed towards  me had racial undertones as a white person of Irish heritage.

2021-06-18,"Paddy Power sucks! I had my fourth day at Ascot all planned out, the night before the rain changed the ground condition, and so most of my bets were showing that apparently more than half of the horses I'd bet on, were now non runner's and paddy power had given me my money back, but at a reduced rate - as if I'd cashed out myself.. 18p Ew changed to 14p / 11p and so on, I only place silly little bets, 9p Ew, 20p wins and so, the final settled amount i received back was 1.60 less than it should of been. Whilst trying to figure out what went wrong, I see the horse I'd bet on in the first race an apparent, 'non runner', run and win! So, cheers, for that ya paddy plonkers. I've cancelled my account, and let them keep the 1.60 they took for the non runner's that actually ran just fine - let alone what I would have won - and have moved over to bet365, pp absolutely ruined my fourth day of Royal Ascot. If you want a fair site, use anything other than them, oh and removing yourself from the site, means you have to declare you have a gambling problem, to which they inform you, you are also banned from using Betfair. Awful site, impossible to leave without having to falsely agree to being an addict to gambling and I honestly couldn't think any worse of them than I do after today's fracas. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

Problem is, when I checked to see if the funds were there, they were nowhere to be seen. I immediately got on to the helpline, where I was told that they have been having problems with the Cash Card + accounts and were trying to rectify it.  This has caused me great stress. Not only have I had another winning expericence ruined by PaddyPower, it annoys that they have no idea when my problem will be resolved. They also didn't announce that there was a problem with the Cash Card + accounts. Why did they allow this transaction to go ahead, knowing full well that there was a problem?I warn everybody with a PaddyPower account not to use Cash Card + at all. Otherwise more customers like me will have there money put in limbo for an indefinite period, with no time frame given to when you will receive your money.Disgraceful!",1

When the app doesn’t work and you go online instead somehow they believe you have two accounts and block you. Had the same issue with Novibet but they both have such bad security and customer service they don’t realise it’s them that are making a mistake and blocking customers for a problem they caused. Terrible customer service.,1
2021-06-12,Terrible. You can't telephone them and they have no email address. This morning I played a supposedly free Wonder Wheel spin game. I won 5 free spins and proceeded to use them. Having used the spins I was disgusted to find that  £7.50 had been removed from my balance! I never play the gaming - only the free Wonder Wheel once a day. Never again. Trying to contact PaddyPower is a nightmare. I will just have to write this off. I have an ante-post bet on the Euro football otherwise I would have closed my account immediately. I will close my account after the football bet is settled. There are plenty of other bookies to choose from - I will join one where you can actually speak to someone! I am very angry about this - particularly as I am unable to resolve the issue. .,1

They've made some wins to you maybe before, just to get used to it, but whoever I've talked to in the last 6-9 months they loses and continues to lose.They even close your account one morning after losing days, under the so-called responsible gaming, but meanwhile, they put the money in their pockets!RTP rates are lies, the only way to win in their games is bonus or free spins, there is very little chance of it coming, in short, you can't win at all! For example, there are 1000-2000 spin losers here! Imagine playing with 0.20 or 1! So what will you gain in the end? Zero! To be clear, you will not find the RTP rate on these sites passing by what is stated, but if you ask, we express it with millions of spins, we compile RTP!

After spending £100,000 in 4 years (I can afford it) last month they just closed my account after I withdrew £3000, only the 3rd time I'd made a withdrawal. They said they needed proof of who I am and my finances (after 4 years) I sent them all the documents they asked for and have had no reply and my account is still closed BY THEM. No phone number to call and my account closed. My MP is very interested as is a Parliamentary Select Committee and Channel 4 Dispatches.

Our security team can close accounts as a business decision at their discretion. Unfortunately we would not have any further information regarding the reason for closure.

2021-05-13,Really poor live chat experience. A couple of days ago I deposited £20 and placed a £10 bet but my balance was now zero. I went on to LC to enquire what was going on and was informed (after waiting 40 minutes) they were having technical issues. The staff member had spelling mistakes in every other word and informed me once the issues were resolved I would get my £20 refunded back to my balance so I was under the impression no bets were accepted. So I went to. Skybet to place my bets instead.They only returned £10 to my account so I went back on live chat with screenshots telling me I was getting £20 back and they just didn't want to know. They told me the bet was on and that was that. Pretty poor to go back on their word. Offered me a £10 free bet once I told them I wasn't going to bet with them anymore.They don't have a call centre or email address so the only way you can get something resolved is by going on live chat for an hour. There's no common sense or discretion used by the operators (which is the same for any bookie)The experience with paddy isn't too bad as long as you don't need to contact them but once you do need to it's a disaster.,1

Yes I got my £10 back, but NO I'm not happy. I should have had £50 in my account. I took screen shots of the bet Transaction number to prove that my bet was taken.  I waited about 40 mins online, 'They don't have a Customer number to call'. Pradrag answered replied and the only thing he could say is I will be refund. Refunded I was, but it's not a refund I wanted, but my Winnings!! He then proceeded to terminate my conversation with him because I asked again for my Winnings. He said we were going round in circles. So I've not got anywhere with that. They have the cheek to put out silly advertisements , Saying no silly horseplay. Horseplay is all you'll get from betting with this shower of criminals. I'm going to let everyone know on my Facebook and Youtube channel to avoid this criminal company with there money.

It wasn’t even a lot of money but the lesson I learned was you have zero integrity and that says a lot because I was a happy customer of paddy for a long time both instore and online . You obviously need the money or you wouldn’t have welched on a bet . When I asked how many places you pay in a 9 runner handicap you couldn’t even give a straight answer so best of luck .

THEY WANT YOU to lose as much as possible and I'm sure they apply this method to other aspects of their website.Well paddy power, I notice this bull. Yes its your site you can give promotions to who you want. However I hope people understand 'Free promotions' are only employed to try encourage more losses, not as a gesture of goodwill from paddypower. I wont be increasing my deposits and instead you get outed in public. This kind of petty tactics makes me wonder, if I ever won any money, they would probably not pay out unless you are already in a massive hole with them.

2021-04-11,"Deposit after deposit with no joy, bingo has same name winners and as for the slots do not even bother, yet another site who teamed up with competitors on grand national race day to lower rtp as they knew they would have more custom than normal.A small update for things to watch out for when playing here......The truthSo, I'm going to go through some the the tricks to look out for as prove there scamming, some of you may have notice before but not really taken enough notice.1. The good old log you out trick, often logs you out during longer game plays on slots this is usually when the operator is shift changing. Your notice on returning back into the site your be on a dead spin cycle as your account was added to the new shift log.2. Stun freezing or pinch lag , this is not your connection it's them changing your outcome eg. RTP after you see this your go on a dead spin cycle usually too 0 balance but right before it hits 0 your receive a small consolation prize like 6x.3. Jumping from slot to slot and window hanging at 99%, this is because you changed provider and there tracking you to add you back into the shift log, it usually requires a refresh of the page or even a relogin.4 switching from slots to live games signalling, what this is if site deem your balance as cash dump account your name will display in red in the live studio to the live games host look out for them glancing left as you first login the screen is top left of the host. This will effect your betting try it of you disbelieve me place all number on roulette leave 1 number open I'll bet it hit the number you don't cover.5, forcing redeposit , now this one is free will but if your a gambler your get what I mean. On your last few spins after the slots has drained your whole balance your notice a longer duration spin this will either be a tease for that bonus you been chasing or a manipulated win of 5x just to get you to redeposit from another round !6. Set balance , this one is the scam they use most frequently for example your deposit £100 during how ever long they decide your balance will stay between that number it will never go over or lose too 0 this is there fair play system but you will never profit! Your know when this is happening because high tier bonus features especially on blue prints will pay 0- 10x. I personally have had the max bonus and got 3x completely manipulated wins. None of the RTPs are genuine on the slots they control them all day long !7. Gambling control emails, you probably have had this sent on various occasions but did you know all this is a temp trick to get you to login and deposit. I've spoken to my friend that works for a site and they say they send them when business is slow but it's legal apparently.8, dead spin speed up, you can check this one easy enough auto play speed up scam. Now if your from the UK your spin must be at 2.5 seconds anything less is considered a breach of the GC rulings. Go to king Kong blue print on mobile and click auto play you will notice that after a few spins it will rapidly speed up on dead spins to drain your balance faster !NOW TELL ME YOU HAVENT NOTICE ANY OF THESE",1

2021-03-31,"Initially I though they were great and cared about their customers. If id written this review 5 years ago, I probably woudve given them a 5* review. Their social media accounts are funny and get a lot of traction. They also payout early on bets and refund unlucky losers. I even received some free boxers in the post, thanking me for my loyalty. All sounds great! Unfortunately its all just a marketing ploy. Turns out the moment you start betting sensibly and win some money, their worse than every other bookie. Restricted my account without any explanation. No free bets (all sports) or BOG on the Horse Racing. As a result I signed up to other bookies that did offer these things. I kept my PP account for the odd occasion they offered better odds or more places on the Horse Racing. I noticed tonight that PP offered the best odds for a 2-2 draw in the Armenia vs Romania game. The game got to 2-2 and a red card and open game meant that I felt that cashing out was the right option at the time but the site was down for maintenance. They described this as an ""impromptu maintenance"" After a few complaints from customers below that tweet, they later deleted that tweet and then described it as ""technical issues"". My brother has also received dreadful service after having his account hacked and wasnt given his money back. He logged into his account Boxing Day knowing he had about £35 in there. When he checked his account, his balance was £0. He checked his bet history and someone had bet the £35 using a roller technique betting on Foreign Basketball and Foreign Football events which eventually lost. My brother explained that he'd had his account hacked on Xmas Day (of all days) and he'd never previously bet on such events but PP dismissed this and refused to give any kind of refund. A far cry from the bookie I explained in my first couple of sentences. Im done with these frauds. Awful awful bookie and id suggest taking your money to a more credible bookie.",1

Here you are charged extra for an additional spin of the reel king lights are close to generating a bonus, this suggesting you are paying a premium for a greater chance of realising the reel king bonus. However, prior to being offered the bonus spin the ‘held’ trail is lit if this is to be applied. If not lit the advantage ceases to exist. However, in such circumstances a premium is still applied to the option of a bonus spin. How can this be allowed. Absolutely shameful profiteering and completely unfair and unlawful I imagine",1
2021-03-27,"Avoid, avoid, avoid! Just fell for the promotion con. Signed up for the Bet £10 Get £40 offer but surprise, surprise it was not ‘available for my account’ after I signed up!

2021-03-26,"This is the most disgusting, thriving site I have ever had the displeasure of playing on. Over £100 on one game, at one pound a spin and I won £3. Please explain how this is an rtp of 96%??! This is after I already wasted another £130 on other games winning no more than a couple of pounds every 30 or so spins. Live chat does not work. I have played many sites over the years and never experienced such unfair gaming. I understand that you rarely come out winning and play for fun but this is ridiculous. I am contacting the gambling commission because there is no way this site pat's out anywhere near their advertised rtp it's totally fixed. I'd rather throw my money in the bin. AVOID!!!!!",1

2021-03-26,Please don't waist your cash . I have been spending around 500 a week on paddy power and never have I been close to a withdrawal. I went on coral last week and I have withdrew over 3k.

2021-03-22,"I would give them zero if I could. Had an account via the app which logged me out. I was unable to reset my password and the app didnt recognise my email address. You cant speak to anyone other than messenger on twitter????  They make you jump through hoops sending proofs of ID and do everything they can  not to help you. They say I have a third party account linked to my account which is a Paypal account. Not a problem when you set it up and pay them, only a problem when you want your winnings back. The helpline number doesnt accept calls and their email address bounces back. The chat bots disconnect you when you get close to resolving your query. They refunded my £50 deposit but not the £80 winnings. All designed so they don’t have to pay out.",1
2021-03-22,£50 won on live casino wonderland.Money was in the next day.  Thank youuu,5

2021-03-21,"Previously had my winnings withdrawals straight away via my Barclays visa debit so got paid instantly. I needed to register replacement updated visa debit card and made deposit using new card no problem. When I came to withdraw winnings wouldn't let me withdraw more than I had paid in due to money laundering regulations. I spent 50 mins wait for online support told me email photo bank statement show that transaction. I sent to email given. Then got message saying that email address no longer operates. It then took 5 hours 20 mins for online support to get my card changed. I had to add photo of my card to the chat. As your online chat staff are now doing everything they need training urgently. They did get the winnings paid instantly on my new visa debit card 5 hours later but I had previously withdrawn deposit monies which I have still not received 3 days later. I should have got these monies instantly as per type of Barclays card I have. It took ladbrooks, grosvenor casinos 5 mins to change my card on their systems. PP your service has fallen well below other online chats. I was so stressed out with my experience I can't face contacting online chat support again. Your staff need training on systems and knowledge. Yes there are financial regulations in place but you are using them as excuse not to pay people which is wrong. I think the reviews speak for themselves. You have lost lot of business over last 12 months you would have thought gone extra mile to sort problems.",1
2021-03-21,"Again, like other customers.  We set up an account for Cheltenham because the promotional offer sounded amazing but then the account was suspended and couldn't access the so called offer.

At least most other betting company's have a contact number to speak to them. Please Avoid, not all what they say thry offer is true. Dangerous and untrustworthy company",1

Then After 2 hours on live chat to see where my free bets where i was told that i didn't opt in and used a different sign up, even though i clicked on the link on this advert. I would stick with sky from now on as they actually fulfill their offers.",1
2021-03-19,Absolutely shocking experience following not being credited back £5 for the risk free bet builder in the Chelsea game. This was clearly available on my account and all terms and conditions were met placing the bet builder only for the money to not be credited back after losing. Waited over 2-3 hours each time on the online chat to only be told that this promotion doesn’t appear on your account and if you have any screen shots of this offer. Absolutely disgraceful service and not honouring it’s own offers. Can’t be trusted at all and I will be writing a complaint to the gambling commission.,1

Once again I have emailed the CEO but he will never see the email, it will go to their ""escalations team"".

Their customer service is beyond poor, their emails show they do not read what the customer writes. I have now told them to close the account and not harass me, I copied in the CEO (for what that is worth because the customer service respond anyway without him seeing it.

2021-02-08,My account got suspended after about 2 weeks regarding regulations yet I only deposited £10 and only used my bonus. I was told I would get a phone call within 72 hours which never happened. I then contacted them on messenger and they asked questions which was then resolved. I did not log on for over a week to find my account was suspended again. I queried this and was told yet again its regarding regulations but I hadn't been on the site or played any games. 4 days later I am still waiting for a phone call as they will not resolve it via messenger this time. Absolute joke of a company I cant access my money in my account and no reason to suspend my account what so ever. BE AWARE!!!,1
2021-02-07,"Extremely decieving and cheeky company. Trying all the tricks in the book to get your maximum details, money and emotions to bring them more income. Only semi-positive thing i could say about it is the fairly okay selection of bets you can make, but thats in comparison to other UK bookies. Cheeky asf, don't trust them with your money, knew i shouldnt have trusted them myself with personal information and funds",1

There should be 0 star ratings.",1

Not even a contact number !,1
2021-02-01,"Its actually really a very difficult choice all in all, of who is actually the most repulsive, when it comes down to running accountancy companies. ( sorry i meant bookmakers ) If there were actually genuine odds priced up on the outcome, between these guys, Fred done and chandler, it would be a very tight market. I would imagine, that whoever you fancy, this grinning jerkoff paddy, would attract plenty of support, not just for the reason that they managed to get their grubby little paws on betfair and finally began slowly to sink the ship, ( can anyone here still actually bet more than pennies on that joke sportsbook !!! ) but there own shifty business, with a misdemeanor list as long as your arm and the usual seat at the top table, if you want to play casino or slots, whilst the red alarm goes off like a police siren on your account, the very minute you show signs of being a little bit to good and you are reduced to no more than a £5 bet. Shysters isn't really good enough a word to use for these, but i can think of plenty of them to use to describe them accurately, as can probably 99% of others out there.......Absolute scum !!!",1

2021-01-31,something is wrong with the bingo staff I witnessed cult like behaviors aniti facts not how a site should be run,1
2021-01-30,I highly suspect that the 5star review below is actually one of the staff and highlights why they so incompetent and shouldn't ever be running any gambling site what so ever,1
2021-01-30,"The worse gambling platform ever. The customer service is 0, they are not giving a damn about their clients. They sent me their ""cashcardPP"" to withdraw my money instantly. I just withdraw some money on that card, and after that i realised that my card was stolen/lost. I reported to an agent, and asked for my refund. It's been 7 days, and i received nothing. Every time i contact them, they are saying that there is a ""queue on the payment department"". Everytime the same answer, and my money are still blocked. No one is giving you a time frame, NOTHING. Worse gambling PLATFORM!!",1
2021-01-30,"The bingo staff are scammers, if you ever cashed out  they ban you for no reason and use multiple accounts pretending to be players to do so, this is probably to make you make another account to talk back and protest your ban then ban you for multi accounts",1
2021-01-29,I put money into my account everytime i fancy a bet on virtual racing and fortunately I won £390 when I cashed out it said your winnings will be in your bank in between 2-5 days!Seriously I don't understand why sometimes it goes in my account straight away and sometimes I have to wait like on this occasion!Yet on the sites I have checked they all say you get your winnings into your account within 2 hours now I won the bet on Thursday now I have to wait until monday as I know it takes 2 days to reach my account but why must I wait why should I not get it straight away like other betting shops??????????I wanted it then not have to wait days,3

2021-01-28,"For no particular reason that I am aware of and under the guise of an account review, Paddy Power decided that I was no longer eligible for any promotions including, ""Best Odds Guaranteed"", something which every other bookmaker I have dealings with offers as standard. I do not make a profit on my betting but I use it as a bit of fun so why I should suddenly be snubbed in this way makes no sense but given the circumstances I have decided to close my account which is probably what they wanted anyway. Great customer services - pity the zero star wasn't available.",1

2021-01-28,"May 25th update. Wow, what's going on with both Paddy Power and Betfair? The user experience has gone right downhill. Whenever you chat to anyone, it feels like you're not being listened to and that everything is okay because the gaming commission in Malta says it is. Really???I can't believe the negative reviews on here. Paddy Power offer the best deals and incentives for using their service, as opposed to anywhere else. Every single day there is a brilliant offer. Such as them paying out 1st and 2nd as winners of a specified race, money back as a free bet if 2nd, 3rd or 4th as well as many more.Paddy Power even sent me a christmas present (winter hat) through the post this winter.The website is easy to use, and withdrawals are paid back to you almost instantaneous.I honestly don't know what more they can do! I think a lot of the people leaving such bad reviews are either problem gamblers, or talking straight through their pocket. Keep up the good work Paddy Power!",3
2021-01-27,"By far the WORST and most CORRUPT site I have ever had the pleasure of coming across. Ebry part of the site is CORRUPT there is ZERO value for money ANYWHERE in this site. The Games are all CORRUPT, DO NOT PLAY ANY GAMES AT ALL!! The promotions are all terrible, the tournaments are ALL completely  worthless and money pits, all games in tournaments have ZERO win lines. The bingo section is also a complete waste of time, highly rigged in every room and very poor prize money all round.PLEASE check all other betting sites b4 coming near this place as almost every other mainstream betting site is good value for money. PLEASE don not waste time of money in PADDYPOWER. Even the customer service is non-existent. STAY AWAY !!",1

I was told to email a betfair address and explain my issue, which I did. They responded by saying it was nothing to so with them and to contact customer services again, which I did. I answered all the security questioned asked and again forwarded all the request documentation and after a few minutes they responded by saying account  won't be reopened.  I asked the question why as I had provided all forms of ID, but they couldn't give me an answer. I felt that they believe I am not telling the truth and I am being discriminated against as I am a women with an online account. Why ask for all my details twice, which I forwarded, just to be told we are not reopening. Very poor.",1
2021-01-22,"I cant place more than 3 or 4 pounds on any sport across the board: Bets restricted on Horse Racing, Tennis, Football, MMA, etc.They run multi million pound ads on Sky Sports during their football coverage and I cant place more than 3.84 on Chelsea to win the 2020/21 title. They cant have my little itty-bitty stake money compromising their 150+ million annual profits. They have billionaires to protect- god bless them!They will restrict your stakes to stupid amounts if you are not a mug!I'm restricted on every sport, but there are no such restrictions when I use their trashy casino. I am free to literally burn through thousands there!!! AVOID!!!!They run these stupid and goofy ads on the TV, but they are not a bookmaker for the common man like they want you to believe. These guys need to be exposed.100% useless!! Remove the ludicrous restrictions, Paddy!!!!! Play fair!!",1
2021-01-22,They don’t even deserve one star! I was excluded from them 2 days ago purely because I self excluded from Betfair. They are apparently now a joint company and if you exclude from one that applies to both! I had no problem with Betfair but did not like their website. I explained that to both companies but no joy. I find it unbelievable but just making everyone aware of falling into the same trap. I actually like the PaddyPower app but do they care? NO! The question is if they are now ‘married’ why are they still operating separate websites? Answers on a very large postcard....could it possibly be the money they both make??,1

I've actually spoken to their CS about this and they laughed and made a joke about and gave me a free bet. Since that moment EVERY bet I've made has had problems re cashout. They know what they're doing. They're rats. Their casino is absolute (theyve made me rephrase this) pleasuring oneself by oneself . Only ever play live casino as they can't fix that. Their slots have to be the worst on the planet. In fact, I think, they're known as the worst in visible space. I can imagine there are life forms on Jupiter who are, at this moment in time, writing a bad review on their trustpilot site. You will win a couple of times but ultimately YOU WILL LOSE.",1

My six months comes up, I successfully deregister from gamstop and im now able to use my old accounts.. sky no issue at all straight in. Tombola had a lovely women speak with me just to make sure I know there safety options and will reopen in 24 hours cool down.. ojo straight on etc ect Anyways..I hadn't even gone to see paddy power, but I received an email saying we have closed down a duplicate account (never had one) so I go onto live chat.. this is how chat went..Me: I just received an email saying you've closed my account as it is a duplicate, I have never made 2 accounts for paddy power. I have however just come off a 6 month ban. Whilst this was on I never attempted to log on and least of all made a new accountChris: i can see you have placed a permanent exclusion on one of your accounts on the paddypower/betfair network. Im afraid we will not be able to remove this exclusion from your account under any circumstances for your own safety. Me: because of gamstop? It was only a 6 month banChris: we have you down as a permanent ban. You will need to speak to gamstop to contact if thats not the case.Me: its no permanent ban and all my other accounts elsewhere have opened with no problems?Chris: as I have already said, you will need to contact gamstop and them to contact us about thisIn short I cant get back on site and to be honest when I spoken to like a child I have no plans on doing so.

Now paddy just swallows the money, doesn't give bonus rounds, or if it does the payout is ridiculously low (pence at times).

I was restricted for nothing and left unable to use the weekly free bet.They removed promotions a few days ago, must have been scared because I won 40 pounds. After that I made the 5 x £5 free bets to qualify for a £5 free bet (yes the miserable £5 free bet, not even the £10) and when the free bet arrived I am restricted to 30p or £2 or £4 depending on what bet I try to make.Therefore the £5 free bet can NOT actually be used.

2020-12-23,"I used to enjoy the site, Never win on the bingo but slots occasionally, and most play even when losing wasn't terrible.  Now the games are a joke,  every single slot is awful.   Played 80 autoplay @1.00 I had 1 return of 40p and the remainder ALL LOST.Ok, maybe that was unlucky, so switched to a different slot reduced stake and again autoplay 19/20 times all lost, 1 occasion I got 8p more than my unit stake woot!   autoplay seems dodgy - plus it speeds up, never seen slots reel so fast so they grab your money quicker.   third slot @1.00 a spin 112 spins -  109 losers  3 returns of 3.24  60p and 60p with that bad luck i switch to slingo 44 games ALL LOST.   I gave up.  Came back today and similar things happening on autoplay.I don't know what has happened but they reduced the weekly bonus - spend 100 on slots get 10 bonus the following week - has now reduced to 5.00 which I always lose on.   I guess I'm unlucky.     I do think autoplay is a con not just on this site, because they mostly lose and they speed up so money is gone faster and faster.  my advice to anyone is not to use autospin you may win once or twice but the sheer speed of the spins is dangerous.",1

2020-12-18,"What started out as a good site has become one of just pure greed. I was asked to be a paddy power bundet in the hope I would get some response as to why my chances of winning anything on slots has reduced dramatically you have to spend around five to tend pound just to get anything back and that means pence not pounds 15 spins before you see the bonus or scatters then you have 11 chances before one is given to which you win 1 to 3 pound if your lucky. This site needs investigating. Ive played over 500.00 these last six months and although I pretty much raked even right now they have hundreds from me without any chance of redeeming a win. I guess greed took over. it used to be fun, it isnt anymore and i will be taking my money else where, I suggest you do the same. it isnt about poor sportsmanship or sulking its about extortion and corruption, you can see the patterns in the reels this is set up for you to lose every time. I'd also like to know who has ever won a jackpot because they seem to grow but never a win. Sadly it seems others are following this example perhaps a closer look and investigation needs to be the next step for a fair chance of game play. paddy power do not play fair.",1

2020-12-16,"They settled the US presidential election prematurely. They stated that they would not settle until there is no uncertainty on who the winner is. But they settled and stated that future events will not change the settlements. There are ongoing lawsuits, investigations and hearings. What happens if Biden's electoral votes are voided and awarded to Trump? What if they prove there was fraud and void the whole election results altogether? What if they prove the fraud, the Biden's win is fraudulent? The GOP sent their own electors in 7 contested states so the elections remain under contest. That's plenty of grounds for uncertainty. I tried to call them, no one answered the phone or replied on the live chat and I waited for a very long time. I am seriously surprised they've done this. I expected better. Very very poor.",1

2020-12-15,"Anybody here from the US election.? Paddy power literally changed the rules at the last minute on the US election for Donald Trump & settled all bets on the December 14 electoral college meet. They are basing the entire bet on that meet alone now, Instead of the actual next president of the united states to be inaugurated. They have admitted if trump wins the election in January that they will not pay out to its customers who were betting on the next president not the total number of electoral college votes in a disputed election. The Entire electoral college votes could be contested in Congress and the entire election could be brought to the house & the US senate to decide the presidential outcome. This is totally criminal we BETTED ON THE NEXT PRESIDENT! You have no right to call the election yourselves when the electoral college votes HAVE NOT BEEN CERTIFIED. Never ever again will I make a bet with the bookies totally fraudulent.",1

2020-12-10,Closed my account while i was in the middle of playing slots and kept £85 belonging to me. I had deposited less than 5mins beforehand from my bank account. Went on to chat and they told me it was due to a verification issue with my 'BETFAIR ACCOUNT' (A verification issue that was caused by BETFAIR forcing me to change my email address) Sent them everything they asked for within a couple of hours and now its 40 day later and they've stopped replying to my emails. I've emailed Support and the Escalations team multiple times and noone replies. They do see the emails because the only response i got from them was when i requested a SAR. Thats only because they are legally obliged to.

Over the 5 games I played I got one bonus and that was on centurion, in which I got road to Rome so I was pretty excited (a good bonus) it gave me 40p! I didn't get a pop up or bonus on the other games and no big wins. I mean that's just absolutely ridiculous, I've played on some really awful websites but at least they pay some kind of return out. I'd be very cautious with this site for slots, closed down permanently. Don't let this be another review that puts you off, see for yourself with a cheeky tenner and come back here to like my review when you agree.

2020-11-21,"Almost 3 weeks ago I noticed just by chance that I did not receive as much as I thought from a winning bet. I informed their agent who said I was paid the correct amount. After insisting and proving I wasn't I then received the correct amount. This has now happened multiple times, and i only noticed this because I don't believe any of their results and the returns they pay. I raised this issue so many times and was told it was being escalated for a manager to look at. Not once did I receive a response from a manager. So if this has happened myself multiple times in the past few weeks, I can't begin to imagine how many other times it has happened in the past to myself and millions of other customers. Having raised this again only today and demanding a manager take this seriously, I was robbed off with a response stating they always advise customers to check their return to make sure it's correct. I have been underpaid and not paid at all on a bet that their system acknowledged as winning. They clearly are aware this is happening in a widespread basis but simply do not care, after all it inflates their profit margins dramatically. Use another bookmaker who is not knowingly screwing you out if your money. And if you do decide to remain a customer, check all results and winning returns with someone else more reputable. After all it's your money they are taking",1

2020-11-16,"So I placed a bet at under 140.5 total points on a basketball game. The score was showing incorrectly, I accept that. However the odds also seemed to be incorrect with the line at 140.5, the reason I know this is because the line changed to 150.5 seconds after my bet was accepted and the score also updated. I believe the line was incorrect at 140.5. If the correct line had been applied at 150.5 my bet would have won. On the flip side if I betted over 140.5 no doubt the bet would have been voided by the traders, so the bookie can’t have it both ways. Absolute scandal that the bet was accepted with the incorrect odds and how does a basketball game score 13 points in 2/3 seconds? Therefore the line at 140.5 could possibly not have been correct. When the bet was placed the line changed to 150.5. The onus is upon yourselves to prove to me that the line was correct at the time otherwise I hold you fully responsible for this and will take this further with the gambling commission.",1

First time I contacted was last week so after 10 days of nothing only to be told I have to wait till that Tuesday to see if it goes in and if not it will be the Tuesday after. it's now Wednesday 19 days after withdrawing and still nothing so I contacted again only to wait 20 minutes for a response which was just them telling me they are going to refer me to the payments team and that I will have to wait anywhere up to 72 hours just for a response from them. Absolutely Ridiculous I get issues can happen but they don't seems fussed in solving the issues at all.,1
2020-10-06,"IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD. HAD A FULLY VERIFIED ACCOUNT, DEPOSITED £900 TO HAVE FUN WITH FOOTBALL.

CONTINUED BETTING AND BEFORE BED WITHDREW MY MONEY (£3000) HAPPY AS LARRY. WENT ON YESTERDAY AFTERNOON TO HAVE A BET TO FIND THEY HAD CLOSED MY ACCOUNT. REFUNDED MY £900 AND STOLEN MY £2,100!!!!!!! AFTER A BATTLE TO CONTACT THEM (only way you can do is live chat as they have closed all their phone lines) I WAS TOLD THEY WILL NOT PAY ME OUT. DISGUSTING AND HAVE CONTACTED IBAS!",1
2020-10-06,"closed my account because i was disabled and ask very personal and inappropriate questions after suspending my account, been reported to gambling commission, offered £20 free bets to add insult to injury after admitting the questions were offensive. deserve to be shut down",1
2020-10-05,Recently opened an account using a promotion code that promised £30 of freebets. Freebets have not been honored and restrictions have been applied to the account within 48 hours of betting probably because i backed a horse that was backed in form 14 to 1 to 9 to 2 favorite. I also used all there offers money back etc. Disgrace they will happily take money off loosing punters but not those who follow good tipsters and take advantage of offers they do not want the business. How is this allowed? If i shop around buying clothing and only purchase clothes when sales are on i do not get barred from shopping.,1
2020-10-05,"Happy to take your money! But never to pay out.. Very disappointing, absolute money grabbers!",1
2020-10-04,Would never recommend Paddypower.They closed my account for no reason and without any warning so I therefore couldn’t access it. Also they did not refund my account balance or my open bet balance to me.Their customer service is also terrible and it will get you nowhere.Be very careful!,1
2020-10-04,Opened an account I put some bets on Won an acca on my account the same day withdrew the 240 winnings about 10 mins later got an email saying my account has been suspended and I can't withdraw my money  they  can't give me a reason they want picture  proof driving licence bank statement paypal account details I explained why didn't I need them when I deposited money but I need them now I've won? They  Could not give me a reason now I'm waiting to hear back from the security team to make a decision   do not trust this company thieves  currently in talks with the gambling commission who have told me there's been numerous cases with paddy power like this they need shutting down,1
2020-10-03,There is a problem with logging on to my Paddy Power account and I used their online chat support to try and remedy it.  It's a 10 minutes to get past the chat robot another 10 minutes for a human to start chatting and then it took 5 minutes to get a response every time I sent a message to the person.  In the end the agent didn't resolve my problem and simply ended the chat session.  Once I can login again I'll be closing my Paddy Power account.,1
2020-10-02,Paddy power isnt the worst. Very helpful staff okay games the payouts are okay not the best but okay.,5
2020-10-01,username GORDON271072 taking my custom elsewere after years of playing on paddy payouts are a disgrace on any stake but even worse on large stakes beware no feedback on here also from them that just tells you if they cared they be wanting to reply to these complaints bet365 much better betfred also,1
2020-10-01,Dont pay out winning bets be warned!! Won 50p treble on irish lotto just not paying no explanation untrustworthy company. Looking at further reviews not first time they have refused to pay out winning bets,1
2020-09-29,Absolute joke shut mine my mums and dads account down for no reason... followed the refer a friend policy and shut our accounts down with no reasoning no explanation have cheek to put on email have questions click here try to talk to some on guess what you can’t as you have shut the account and have to log in to talk!!!!! Dad had money in his account are you going to pay that no don’t think so banned for doing a promo you emailed to us beware people absolute scam!!!!,1
2020-09-28,Shocking customer service! Can’t speak to a manager get cut off by rude agents. Bet365 a lot better,1
2020-09-27,Really bad customer support can lock your account out for being responsible basically a winner and has taken them a week to address it to ring me. Are you scared of what I will open your eyes too Paddypower? I am responsible just because the lady on the chat was trigger happy and in a locking out mood. Ridiclulous they have the power to lock you out but have no power to unlock it. 1st time in over 20years of using these sites I have been locked out to. Back to school for customer services In my opinion !!! Update from last year still waiting for the call from responsible gambling team nearly 1 year after being locked out. Closed it down they want losing punters only and how responsible of responsible gambling team lol such a joke they want losers only. Or gambling addicts only so they can cash in from addicts or big loser punters that have more money than sense they do not want responsible people on the site ;),1
2020-09-27,Just found that by 1 click an unstable stepson can just click log in and he on my acc I know I'm to trusting leave laptop open for all to use but worse he  shows me how easy he paid into PP just using 3 digit on my card which he knew from getting goods as it was all saved on acc only realised when my card declined in shop an checked online to see he deposited hundreds and I'm now skint he has mental proplems and addictions. I'm checking with legal group why my privacy was not safeguarded better by PP app no safeguards or other checks to verify It was me checking if they failed to protect my privacy rights I know it was a crime on his part and he will be dealt with but didnt realise how easy it was to be let down bad by PP and cant seem to find good way or who to contact il leave it with solicitor to check legal matters just close acc never use one again... better security system needed I'd say in mean time il go hungry for couple weeks,1
2020-09-26,"If you have kind of assistance working for this company you will loose so many customer,I am so glad that I close my account today.You will not get penny from me again Mr Baran Ozcevik",1
2020-09-25,"I have been with PP a few years now, not a big gambler, just a little flutter everday, and never had any problems. Just went to check my account,  logged in, and it say ""Your account has been closed"".Why? I still have money in my account also, not much, but that is not the point.Why has my account been closed, how can I contact them. Very disappointed.P.S. Managed to use the chatbox Saturday, told the agent my problem, and went through a rigmarole to set up a new account with  new email etc. They said they would get back in touch, either, by phone or new email to confirm new account is set up, and remaining funds in my old account will be transferred to the new one....NOTHING YET.  4/10/20Well, PP have finally opened a new account for me, and transferred my money from my old account, it has taken a week to all get sorted, but I suppose I should thank them for that. So thank you for honouring what you said you were going to do and getting an account up and running for me, and retrieving my funds.",3
2020-09-24,"Joined and claims my account status is confirmed and only when i go to start a game i get ACCOUNT LOCKED, it allows to deposit money ect but not actually start a game",1
2020-09-24,They are dreadful. They spend so much on silly gimmicky adverts to get business. Thats because their odds are so poor. Don't believe me?  Check an odds comparison site and they are never best odds on anything in fact they are usually worst odds of the lot,1
2020-09-18,I opened an account 3 or 4 years ago cannot remember  if i placed a bet i probably did might of even won big   but i will never know because Paddy Power erased all records of that account,1
2020-09-17,I play the slots on lots of different sites and leave my feedback on them.ive been on paddy for 2 days put 70.00 in and to be honest i havnt even won a amount just to give me a decent amount to play a bit longer with the deposits ive put in.i can put 20 in some sites and play for a while and i dont even care if i loose as long as i have a few mins fun but on here i carnt even win at a pound a go more than 20p.im not going to leave no stars as i will give it a few more days but paddy you have to let a few wins to have fun winning nothing makes the game flat.,5
2020-09-16,Your site does not payout It’s useless And it’s fixed,1
2020-09-15,Audited. Clearly controled.  Requires investigation.,1
2020-09-14,"Paddy were advertising 9/2 Wolves and Chelsea. I clicked on bet here button expecting it to be placed in my betslip, instead it directed me to the bet club, I pressed join, clicked on terms and conditions but the bet never became available. I repeated this two further times and never saw the bet. Did anyone else have the same issue?",1
2020-09-14,Paddy is a good internet gambling site since the late 80s. Always taken care of me.  I can't understand these 1 star reviews.  And for such low amounts.,4
2020-09-11,I joined paddy power tonight signed up no problems there deposited £10 everything is fine. Headed to the slots account is locked ??? Contacted customer support who assured me everything is fine played my 10er and decided to deposit again all's good been playing for an hour.Wager £10 receive 200 free spins played 122 free spins game account temporarily suspended. I deposited with a debit card my name my address .I HAVE NEVER had to verify by uploading passport. Utility bil and my debit card which I did straight away received a  message if takes upto 24hrs for a human to verify until then my account is locked with £46 credit I'm disgusted  they have taken money from my bank account  without needing to verify who I am .I don't try to withdraw funds I was quite happy playing this is wrong if there was a problem with me opening account why did customer service let me use my account to play and deposit more money on. This is basically theft by deception now I'm contacting Resolver. Ask gamblers to help  warn others. I want my money I deposited refunded back into my account asap and I suggest anybody else with issues with PP do the same. Unless people complain to the site Askgamblers who act as a third party gambling commissioner won't be interested how many online gambling sites in the last six months have closed changed the sites name Google casinos that have had their gambling license temporarily suspended and are under investigation,1
2020-09-09,"AVOID !!! CONTACTED PADDY POWER,ONLY TO BE SHOUTED AT & ABUSED BY A MEMBER OF THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM.OMG ! THIS HAS MADE ME FEEL SO BAD ! PADDY POWER YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR !!! AVOID PLEASE !!!",1

2020-09-07,"Done a bet on the 3rd September 2020 early Thursday morning for the Andalucia Gof Masters 6 places John Catlin 90/1 €20 e/w, no problem with the placing bet, bet taken at 90/1. John Catlin won, went to collect winnings told by employee that system was showing 80/1. Made 2 phone calls with customer service who advised me that the bet was 80/1 not 90/1. This is what customers have to put up with when we win, 10/1 odds removed from winnings and paddy powers are in the right as they say. So no problem taken the bet at 90/1 but your paid odds at 80/1, no satisfaction from customer service and another illegal act by paddy powers. Not finished with this.",1
2020-09-04,"1* is not low enough! Parroted scripted responses. There is a new customer promotion deposit £10 and receive £40 to play and free spins. I tried to contact them- the messenger/online chat does not work on my phone, so I contacted via Twitter. After explaining that, they STILL directed me to their online chat portal!!! And advised they couldn't deal with my enquiry via Twitter!! Conned out of £10 with the promise of a promotion! Misleading and false advertising!! My advice is stay clear! Terrible company and abysmal customer service!!",1
2020-09-03,Terrible company to deal with if you have a problem with anything. They will tell you that their legal team is bigger then you!!! unbelievable,1
2020-09-02,Avoid. Cash outs will be blocked because their servers will not update and suddenly show matches finishing as 'starting soon' completely screwing you. Happens every single time. Have had to contact support over 5 times since joining just to get money back for bets that weren't paid out. Absolute joke of a service.,1
2020-09-02,"Ive been with paddy power for a few couple years now and personally i’d they they are one of the best sites, they treat their customers well with the paddypower rewards, also have get promotions on & free spins, the payouts take about 1-2 days, i only play for the slots but their bets sport have good odds too and helpful tips. Just see a lot of people complaining cause they lost a bit of money ‘Gambling’",4
2020-08-30,Paddypower closed my account for no reason.Kept my money and now my account has been closed i cannot contact them.Complete shower of S**t.,1
2020-08-29,Paddy Power closed my account for business reasons. Repeated attempts to find out why where met with a brick wall. When I raised concerns about GDPR and my cyber security if someone has erroneously used my account they told me its basically tough. Very poor customer service.,1
2020-08-28,"the negative reviews are false, i have had more free bets than i have deposited, liars with negative views, gambling addicts who put there money on slots and expect a big return so they can waste it all away then complain, oillocks WE LOVE PADDY",5
2020-08-28,Don’t play casino or the machines deal or no deal is absolutely dead couldn’t believe how bad anything but the sport bets are the scratch cards all rigged deffo not worth playing anything but sports bets,1
2020-08-24,"I deposited £20( Deposit more than £10 get a free £10 bet after the first bet wins/loses). Placed a £10 bet, decided whilst I was waiting for the outcome 'fingers crossed' , I will try my luck on the slots and won £120, so thinking il stay on the up. Withdrew the £100 and left myself with the original deposit to play with. The bet finished and I lost but I placed on my £10 free bet and won £12 but as soon as it had finished before I could place another bet/play slots or withdraw the money.. BAM account has been closed due to a buisness reason.Wrote to customer services and was given absolutely nothing but cheek about how ""it's been closed and it's managerial level, I cannot question it or get you the answer as to why but you have withdrawn more than you won so have a good day""I asked about my £12 that I had in the account and was told that they ""hold the right to close accounts without returning any money above the deposited ammount""So if you plan on losing play with them if you are thinking you can win some money. Do NOT play with them as if your up they will close the account without giving you any winnings as and when it suits them.Absolutely terrible",1
2020-08-23,"Paddy power is fuc....king crap.....rude costumer service,not helpful at all after I tried to claimed a few bonus that I saw on MY promotions hub and I proved with screenshot and link and I made sure I was logged in for them to see it was on MY hub and they fuc...king said that is for selected costumer and I wasn’t one of them😖😖 and I asked so why it keeps showing on MY fuc...king hub and they suspended my account with an excuse that I was chasing bonus and I told them to go fu....ck themselves....paddy bullchit that what it is",1
2020-08-19,"I don't actually bet much,just the odd time for a bit of fun. Twice Paddy Power has locked my account because of activity they believe was not me. Both times it was (all I did was log on using a different device). Almost impossible to get reopened. Apparently as it's been locked twice someone senior has to review. But they locked it for no reason? Use a different company, I will from now on.",1
2020-08-18,I have a issue with a  money transaction not in bank account I took a break from paddy Power online betting and rang customer care no response  very disappointing considering the money I have gambled expected a lot better from paddy Power,1
2020-08-18,I won on hoops galore came first in the UK and I got a quid for my effort sort it out paddy lad it says I get a 50 pound free bet for coming 1st,3
2020-08-17,Paddy Power have some good special offers like we pay four places on a twelve runner handicap sounds great but they only pay 5th of the odds instead of a quarter but if you take a 16 runner handicap pp pays 5 places at 5th of the odds other bookies pay the first 4 at a quarter of the odds so pp for instance other bookies you end up unlucky 20 to 1 second at a quarter of the odds your return at a 1 pound stake is 6 pounds wher as with pp it would only return a fiver so lets say in this 16 runner handicap the first 5 horses finish 1 2 3 4 5 all at 20 to 1 and in alternate bookies you had a pound place on all 5 horses you would get payed total 24 pounds where as in PP you would get back 25 quid as you have 5 places so WOW you gain one poxy quid and you would only benefit from this special offer in PP if your horse actually finishes 16th so your not even gaining that poxy quid i mentioned mmmm,1

2020-08-10,"Be warned... don’t consider opening an account with this Mickey Mouse operation. My wife opened an account and within days it was suspended... why... because they want to. She had already deposited £20 and that was essentially confiscated. Can’t get a straight answer from their customer services. Use a reputable online betting company. By the looks of their reviews here, they’ve had many many unhappy victims. DONT MAKE YOURSELF A STATISTIC",1
2020-08-09,"I'm probably one of few that have made a good amount out of Paddy power no thanks to them, but they certainly try many tricks to scam you. The most obvious being connectivity issues when depositing in roulette and wanting to double up when confident in a win. Funnily enough I monitor my stability and not the slightest issue. Surprising to see how many other people have similar problems but yet support are just rude and refuse to provide any escalation info.I will take my money and run.",1
2020-08-06,"Six free spins on a feature and logged me out every time just before the reels stop... log back in and spin is complete... Next spin starts and logs me out again... not just once every feature game on some slots... how can thi be an enjoyable experience.?.. takes £15 to get on festure game and then ruined by logging me out... also it states that my experience may be poor due to my browser not supporting webgl, I have the latest tablet with the latest version of chrome.... i have enabled webgl........ i really think their site is not powerful enough to host sophisticated graphics.... if they don't want to invest in good support or quality framework then they should not offer games that are too powerful for their site.........",1

2020-07-21,"Paddy Power are the industry leader online PERIOD! Had nearly every online account available in the last 6 years. PP was my first online account and now with SKYBET’s demise since lockdown eased its my main outlet. Promotions and free bet offers very fair and worthwhile. No aggravation with getting them either. New App is fantastic and smooth and bet settlement has improved massively. Very swift now. Best odds guaranteed is on day of racing which is fine. Messenger and chat service could be better with more knowledgeable staff, but only a small gripe. Priority access card still going strong and contactless payment in shops never an issue. Take heed WILLIAM HILL. Pulled theirs. Results service for racing very good and now all races in UK and Ireland are free to watch, no bet needed. (Most bookies now are though) Extra place races aplenty for eway monsters still widely available. Keep smashing it PP and thanks for the service. 🔥🔥",4
2020-07-19,Use odds comparison sites and this lot will be right at the bottom.

I contacted Paddy Power but only replies I got where links to Gambling addiction wensites.My question is, how could they not notice someone lossing about £10 a week to someone gambling over £40,000 in a fortnight. Where was the warning be aware messages? NONE!!!!I understand this was all down to my wifes illness, but a bit of sympothy and common sense would have gone a miss.

2020-07-12,Poor service - I am a regular customer but during lockdown have not bet since March due to lockdown.  When betting then I was entitled to promotions such as get your money back as free bet if horses place second or third. Started placing bets again since lift of lockdown and PP say I am no longer eligible for promotions due to a business decision.I don't really understand - I bet small - roughly around £20-£30 per week and havent wont any significant bets - my betting habits have not changed in the slightest.  Still no response!,1
2020-07-11,Paddy power online casino is definitely fixed. So i put it to the test yes i deposited £50 and tried a few games out most i got back was £2.50 yes that was the highest win total win was less than £10 with no bonus features one would think you would get back atleaste £30. Paddy power eats money like children eats sweets. I tried the same with William Hill exact same games and won £297 you get regular bonus features. Its entirely up to you however you have been warned. One last thing paddy power dont like complaints they wont respond to reviews and i was absolutely shocked to find that the offers they offer you look good however you need to deposit and play a substantial amout to receive one £250 required wager. They encourage excessive gambling unlike other casinos there site is hard to navigate making it near impossible to take a break if you have issues infact i haven't found that option.,1

Just like debit card.Also there is plenty great free offers which helped me earn extra money for free.I think winnings from slot bonuses is higher then other websites,or maybe is just my luck.Highly reccomended",5

2020-07-04,Don't listen to the negative reviews as it people who are in about losing money which the site has no control over. It's great site for both sports and casino/games with plenty of promotions to keep things interesting. Most importantly they have live chat and e-mail support that is always ready to sort out any problems.,5
2020-07-03,"Paddy SCAMMER more like. I've been paddy scammer customer for about 4 years. Everytime I want to withdraw money I need to send proof of identity, proof of address. Yet to give them your money you need nothing as they already have it already. Customer service is none existing. If you want to start account with paddy power scammer think again.",1

2020-06-29,It's not called dead spin paddy power for nothing! Over £150 on 60p a spin to get a bonus on my last £17 that paid £3.77. Next was over £200 on £1 a spin that got me down to my last £6 and gave me a bonus that paid £4.80 !!! This is disgusting on any amount a spin. Had several dead spins lasting over £30 which is physically impossible if the rtp is playing right. Nobody minds losing if you get a play but you may aswell burn your money than play on this site. Daylight robbery!! This casino is seriously bad and now lost another customer due to their greedy ways. Read all the reviews and DO NOT join this site.,1
2020-06-29,"Don't understand why this gets such a bad wrap, consistent with the rewards club promotion and almost every week you get free bets, yes I'm not always gonna win but I knew that signing up. I just feel these bad reviews are from butt hurt punters who can't accept it when they blow all there money because they don't have the common sense needed to put deposit limits on there account.",5
2020-06-28,Been playing this site now for 2 months. Don't bother. Had 1 bonus from them in this time. Spent loads off money just to win a few pounds much. Cleopatra slot machine for example. Takes nearly an hour of playing to get on the feature. Playing a pound a spin for a 2.75 bonus feature. What! Are you serious. Will be closing this joke site very soon. Do not I repeat do not open a account. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,1
2020-06-28,Just tried to reactivate my account after period of non use due to illness ( account had been suspended - presumably due to non use).Customer service via the live chat was abysmal.Agent simply not interested in assisting.This is the poorest customer service I've ever experienced.The business itself is usually quite good with some of its offers. But it badly lets itself down if this is typical of its administration.,1
2020-06-26,This site needs taking down i started on£25 got to £45 on 1 slot so I went on another slot and didn't get 1 bonus 20p a spin how is this possible if I was playing in the bookies I guarantee I would get a bonus yet again paddy power explain how this is fun getting no bonuses uk gambling commission needs to sort it out because something seems dodgy,1
2020-06-25,"Avoid this company. I signed up to them using a promo code for 200 free spins. After signing up, giving them all of my details, verifying my account and mobile number, my account became blocked. I spent 20 minutes on live chat to be told I need to give them my driving licence, passport, bank statements, utility bills. I've done this with reputable companies before, but only when I withdraw my balance, if they were going to ask me to provide all of this they should have requested this beforehand, before they harvested all of my personal data. I requested to have all of my details removed but was told this would have to go to a different team and they couldnt provide me with any time frame on when this would be done as there is apparently a queue for this! Avoid this company, there are so many better companies out there with much better customer service.",1

Once I got on the feature reel it gave me a poxy £1.50! Terminated my account. There odds for sports are also by far the worst compared to there competitors! Stay clear ! Seriously something not right there.",1

2020-06-18,"Another outstanding platform! I am firstly a poker player which I take very seriously. I love playing poker on this site but I also enjoy letting go on the slots and black jack. As for the casino it’s fun and the link with Age of Gods and poker is a great move from the software creators. The games are fast, furious and exciting! To be honest PaddyPower is a carbon copy of many other sites. What separates them is an excellent loyalty program, a wealth of incentives, super fast payouts when you win and excellent customer service! Keep doing what you’re doing! 💯✅",5
2020-06-18,Easily the best there is! New website and mobile layout is stunning and the free bets are great. Payout in seconds and great live chat customer services.,5
2020-06-18,"Shame they scam so many people legaly, saying they give a certain procentage back, as in fact the procentage is minimal, egual with no chance to win ever",1
2020-06-18,"The betting site and the free bets you get are brilliant, they definitely look after their customers in that regard.The slots however are a totally different matter, there is a good selection of games, which makes the choice of background you would like to choose as you watch your bank roll disappear quicker than Dynamo The Magician the only plus. I have never known anything like it and I play a lot of slots, if you manage to get a bonus, please don't get too excited as it will likely be below what seems to be their lofty limit of £3.00.I would love to know how their RNG works, as it seems the more money you give them the less likely you are to win, truly shocking. When the fun stops stop they say, on Paddy Power games it never starts.",2

2020-06-17,I bet in shop and online and Never had a problem with paddy power by far the most generous bookies regarding free bets and withdrawal takes only 15-20 to reach my bank account.,5
2020-06-17,"Absolute joke of a company....WORST bookmaker that I've ever dealt with.Had to verify my identity and address....sent photo of passport, bank statement and medical form ALL with my address on then they still want me to send more. I just told the guy to close my account.....I already wasted 45 minutes and wasn't wasting any more of my time because the clown dealing with me didn't trust ALL the proof that I'd already provided. Utter clown!!!",1
2020-06-17,Great company to bet with.Easy to verify with and no hassle to withdraw money unlike lots of rival bookies.Also by far the most generous with lots of free horse racing and free football £5 bets for all customers recently.Silly hills zero free betsLadcrooks £1 (. But my account is suspended !!!)Will be staying with paddies for online and retail bets in future.  🐎🐎🐎🐎,5
2020-06-16,"Joined today for Ascot..... have me so many free bets it was ridiculous, which ultimately I Lost then they game me another ten free bet, and two £5 free bets!! Paddy Power is very generous and deserve my money will be betting with them from now on!!!",5
2020-06-15,Excellent bookie. Not sure what the complaining is all about. People not reading T&C properly most likely. Lots of good offers on sport. Fast settlement on payouts. Recommended.,4
2020-06-14,"They close your account for no real reason, if you win on your first few bets. They will ask for a multitude of personal details and documents before returning any winnings to you. You can not have these details deleted by them afterwards.I did eventually get my initial deposit returned after emailing probably 20-30 times, as they have no phone line.The biggest gamble with paddy power is not the bets you place, it's that if you do win will they just close your account and take your money anyway.",1
2020-06-13,Depositing money is hassle free but it’s a different story when you try to withdraw. What were the odds of that?,1
2020-06-13,I ❤️ PP best site around... Never had a problem with them.... Great job PP 😁,5
2020-06-13,"Dont know why people are complaining, the odds they give are reasonable, last week they gave out ,5 free £2 bets on the horses, won £15, was in my bank the next day, won £700 on a bet once alls they wanted was my passport money went in two days later.. go on today and cos their site was down last night they've given us a 10 pound free bet and a £5 free bet.. no catches btw.. this is the best site to use in terms of free bets , promotions and pay outs... and no I dont work for paddy power. Just your average gambler, this site pays out more than sky bet ever has!",5

I was asked to send a copy of my passport, a recent utility bill and a copy of my bank card to verify my identity. Reactivated my account but blocked it again and requested the same documents a second time. Customer service is not helpful, saying ""routine checks"" are part of their t&c. In reality it seems they are just making it very easy for you to play but incredibly complicated for you to withdraw your money. Avoid like the plague.",1

Been betting with them solely online for over 10yrs and just closed my account after been cheated out of 2,360 because the cashout didn't work, all I get is sorry to hear that. That's what you get for been loyal. Thanks PADDY.",1
2020-06-11,The odds they have are the worst around. Just have a look on oddschecker. There's never any value on any markets. Always consistently bottomThat's why they do all this fake Twitter matey type thing and silly promos and other nonsense to take away from the fact they are a joke when it comes to decent prices. It's amazing really how vocal they are on social media and such why they don't reply on here.. I asked them on twitter why odds not competitive and got blockedStrictly for the muggy acca brigade,1
2020-06-09,Gave a one as that's the lowest allowed. Felt as a regular player that I was treated appallingly because I was a regular.  I work hard and like to play games to relax especially at the moment.  They kept blocking me and basically really don't deserve my money.,1

2020-06-09,"Awful company!I placed a 4 competition accumulator with a fairly large amount of money. Literally the week before the corona virus stopped everything.My bet is still open however 3 out of the 4 competitions will not continue. No games have been played since I place my bet so nothing has in theory changed. Paddy Power have said they would turn the bet into a Single but I would never had place the bet if it was a single. If I placed the bet at the beginning of the season and loads of games had been played I would understand they cant return the money, but at this point nothing has happened. So why cant they just give me my money back? We are in the same position had had I asked for an immediate refund 30 seconds after the bets was placed.I get when you put a 10 game accumulator on and 2 games are void due to bad weather or something. but my bets are very specific and across 4 competitions. So turning it into a single is just not the same bet at all.I even said they can leave it in my account for me to have to use again if they want. I just don't think I should be forced into a bet I didn't want to place when there has been no loss to Paddy Power. I had a similar situation with Bet365 and the refund was made after a 2 minute live chat conversation.Don't use paddy power",1

Every time I try and opt in to any of them offered on their site I get a 'Not Eligible' message.

2020-06-02,I wish I'd read the review's before I joined!This is possibly the worst site I've ever played on.

The email also clearly stated that there are NO other restrictions. Fine - I was going to continue playing even without bonuses, but I found out that I was also stake restricted - for example I want to stake 2 or 5 on a horse and the website tells me my maximum stake is 0.46?? what?I call a friend and ask him about his maximum stake on same bet - he tried 100 - no issues at all. The website then asks me to make my stake over the phone - the hell?I contacted live chat - they said no other restrictions except bonuses. Then I prove them with screenshots that I am actually restricted and my friend is not - and they say its not true and I should try to make stake over the phone. This is ridiculous.After contacting 3 different chat agents for 3 days - they all claimed the same - I decided to try over the phone. So I asked the guy what the problem is - he refused to help, but asked me what stake I would like to make - I picked a random game and told him I wanted to make a 2 pound stake, and website allowed me to make only 0.80. He then said he will ask ""the traders"" - and they replied ""we have no confidence in this game, thats why your stake is restricted"" - LOL. And in this very moment my friend was with me and he could make a 100 pound stake on the same bet and on the same game.What a BUNCH of liars and morons. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!",1

Because I didn’t had a card attached to my account it was need to be made by bank transfer with an estimate time of 5 days . On 18.05.2020 I contacted the support service where I’ve been told to wait 24h more . On 19.05.2020 i contacted again the support service where I’ve been told to wait until Wednesday 20.05.2020 ...on Wednesday I contacted the customer service where I’ve been told that my funds has been returned to my account because my bank declined the transaction ( I’m using the same card on more than 2 different gambling platforms never having problems with them ) I’ve been advised to choose another card for a bank transfer..at that moment being tired of contacting them all the time I decide to continue playing until I made 20£ money that I tried to withdraw again this time contacting the support support where someone tells me that it can be done by “ express bank transfer “ where I will have to pay a 6£ tax . That being said I will be left with 14£ in my account ( not a problem , I was wondering if this time they will proceed the payment) on Thursday 21.05.2020 i received an email where it was said that my account has been closed as PP decide this without any explanation and all the actual funds will be transferred to my account. I contacted the customer support again where an agent very rude pass me very fast telling me that my funds will be available in my account.

Scumbags and scammers.",1
2020-05-23,Again like everyone else this is a shocking site. I am the fool for thinking it was good fun and getting carried away in these hard times and quickly lost a rediclious amount. But then they do their tactics of having you as a vip and offering you seats at place and venues. Making you feel comfortable and genuine.Took months for me to realise but once my deposits were smaller and  i actually started to win my account a month ago was just closed.Forget vip. Trying to contact them they just pass you off saying now the reps are not available ans that it is a external compliance team that make decisions and thats it.A week after making only a few small withdrawals the account was closed. They let slip that it was a message from the compliance team that it had to be closed. It was same time as everyone else.They regularly gave me bonuses when i had pointed out game play issues ans not paying out on one occassion.Clearly i was asking too many questions and all they do is say its different hosts for the games.For the love if god everyone please stay clear.  Even with deposit limits when your stuck you find a way and its all too easy to get drawn in.There will be people suffering along side us all in these times. This needs ro go to a watchdog somehow. Before people harm themselves.They are smart as they have in their terms ans conditions that they do not have to even give us a reason to close or suspend. But we never think we will get as deep as we do.,1
2020-05-23,"Just like everybody else says ...I will not complain about winning or not ,these are random number generators programs. All will be ok with you until you win a little bit more ,in percentage ,compared with your deposits...They will start asking all sort of proofs,ID,money sources,etc .Again nothing to complain here as they are required to do so by the Money Laundering Laws .But ..once those provided if you are still net positive over a longer time they will close it with no warning and no possibility to talk with anybody.No matter what you do you will never be able to reopen for no reason.This is of course a disgraceful behaviour,my guess is not singular among this operators ... Even if you have some VIP appointed representative.Mine was a fella named Finlay Kerr.Avoid at all costs",1

Any body who has any supporting statistics or footage etc etc etc please leave contact details...I am not a disgruntled punter far from it...

2020-05-18,Probably one the worst online casino experience one ever experienced. You could loose and not winning anything for over 300-500 spins on slots. What kind of casino is that? The customer service is not friendly either. Spent thousands of euros on this site and one little problem they will not help you after reporting it and I ended up asked to terminate my account and delete my personal datas off their premise but they refused to do so. Highly NOT recommend to anyone. Stay away from these crook.,1

2020-05-05,"Not good at all stay away from this site.£40 playing 20p stake (yes 20p stake)added all my penny wins up and it equated to about £10 back.Absolutely no sign of  a bonus.many many empty spins.Money gone in minutes and no gameplay at all.Sadly alot of these sites are the same now because they are allowed to get away with it.They are regulated apparently,have the G.C actually played the games on sites like Paddy Power ( not a  chance because there is no way they would say that it's gis kind of play or total lack of is acceptable.The gambling Commission are not fit for purpose.",1
2020-05-03,"Like everyone else has said. I put £20 in my account and accumulated a bit of money did a withdrawal of £60 then another of £40. There was no problems with this then I had 10p left in my account and I decided to get 2 tickets on fluffy bingo. I did not get a bingo but the bonus at the end of the game rewarded me £75. Super happy and chuffed. So I thought I will withdraw £65 of it and leave my self with £10. Tried to withdraw to find the page wasn't loading to instantly have an email from them say my account has been suspended and I need to prove my ID for my account to be reactivated. Followed the link that they provided on the email so I could upload my proof of ID. This required me to sign in so I put my details in only to find because my account is suspended I can not login to my account, meaning I can not supply them with proof of ID. I looked everywhere for support and it was very hard to come by. In the end I went onto the help page and and had to click help on something that wasnt relevant to me in order to bring a chat up, because if you click help with documents you have to sign in to start that chat. So I spoke to a lady of the evening on chat which took over a hour in total due to her very very slow response. For her to tell me she has all the proof but it needs to be assessed by someone else and she can not give me a time frame, by this point I was tired and accepted the answer. Waking up in the morning I felt very annoyed with the answers I had been given. So again i started a chat again, i asked how long will this process take, the agent replied they had recieved the documents this morning and that it should be done within 72 hours but can take longer. So I said that's fine, I then asked the question, so if i havent heard anything in 1 week should i get back in touch, she replied no you will get a email to confirm you're verification you do not need to contact us again. I said but you have stated it can take longer then 72 hours, this could mean it could take 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, you are not telling me a time frame. She then replied we have your documents and you will be emailed once they are verified and then ended the chat completely. I have read the reviews on here and thought surely it cant be that bad. But it is, its absolutely shocking. So the money that I had requested to withdraw before my account was suspended is now on 'hold' until my account is verified. Do you think my account will be verified LOL. I very much doubt it but we shall see. Avoid this site like the plauge!",1

I opened a case via Resolver and the replied saying that they were not changing their minds and were stopping any replies via Resolver! So basically, they shut you down.They have picked on the wrong person because I am preparing to go to an Alternative Disputes Resolution and if necessary, the small claims court. They are imposing Unfair Terms in favour of themselves.

When every transaction is monitored by them they could tell you within a few minutes your figures for everything  but I caught them with their pants down played thousands of pounds on various games at £10 a spin and never had 1 feature not even one....Heard the same story from many players loads of complaints to gambling commission from many people And nothing done....I advise everyone to contact MPS and bring  a civil case as a group against them...We strategically go after them in a lawful manner and if that doesn't work...

2020-03-18,"Opened an account on the second day of Cheltenham races as I work with someone who is clued up about horse racing and seemed to keep winning. Uploaded £10 to put on 1 race which ended up winning, so my balance went to £40. Tried to withdraw the funds, which led to the account being suspended due to failing security checks. I can understand that opening & withdrawing on the same day could look a little dodgy, so I uploaded the required documents to prove who I am. A week went by without any confirmation of receiving or unblocking the account so went to their live chat. The guy I spoke to asked me to uploaded a photo ID, which I did, and he unblocked the account. Great stuff. Attempted to withdraw the funds again, only for another email the following morning once again saying my account is suspended. This is not good enough. I understand there are regulations around betting etc, but I shouldn’t be having to do this again after my account has already been verified. Maybe these sites should ask for verification before allowing you to deposit anything to start with, as they are quick enough to take your money in the first place.

2020-03-16,"Absolute crap. Spent 5 hours rolling slots with low wager to just nose dive non stop without ever once getting back close to initial deposit. Will never deposit here or any other such site again. There is no way it is fair, I don't care what regulations there are, it is all meaningless nonsense. It is rigged in some way or another. If the site/game detects you are new, you will win a little at first, lots of bonuses etc etc, make sure to throw all the fancy sound and graphical effects at you, make you excited, make you think you are lucky and can actually win something. Then you loose a little, win a little, back and forth, never giving big profit but enough to make you think you can win. Then they test you with a bad streak followed by a 'big' win. Big in the amount but either not enough to put you back to your deposit or just a bit over. Rinse and repeat. I started playing the slots 3 days ago, going back and forth without ever winning or losing. I got tired of it so withdrew whatever I had left. Suddenly I see a promo for free spins which was not there before. 1st free spin, big win. Now I'm interested again. Their trick worked, they realised I wasn't hooked yet as I had withdrew so they fed me free spins with a guaranteed big win. I am back to spinning. Back and forth a bit... THEN Nose dive. You deposit more. Now they know you are hooked. Take Take Take.. non stop, hours and hours and hours. The site detects you are desperate, so it continues take take take. I tried different games, all taking like theres no tomorrow. Back to the main game I was playing on, still taking. Even the slots are glitching now, its like its modifying the roll to continue its taking. Lots of prolonged rolls, graphical glitches, error codes which were definitely not there when first playing.They are designed to hook you then steal from you. I noticed the exact same pattern more than once. I'm completely new to gambling on online slots. I joined a couple of casinos a few days ago to try them out. They all done the same pattern, entice you at first, make it seem fair and fun, with a possibility of winning but little possibility of losing. Then they flip, the game goes from fun and fair to complete money sucker no matter how many hours you spend, it will not stop taking as long as you are continuing. I am out, 100% convinced they are all rigged. Thank you Paddy for saving me money by being so blatant. I used to bet on sports (still lost but didn't care) After trying the slots, I have no interest in either now as I have no interest in giving money to a platform which is running deceptive shams. This was eye opening and in a way I am glad to have paid for the experience of realising the truth about online slots. I am down few euro but you will not get another cent from me and I hope this review convinces others to stop. Do not go back. There is no chance to win if you continue to play after the 'hook' period. They are designed by very smart people to take advantage of emotions in a way that the only possible way to win, is by stopping and do not return. They say when the fun stops stop. But they intentionally design the games in such a way as that by the time the game is no longer fun, they have you hooked. When the fun stops, we make sure you cant stop is what the slogan should be. Nobody can have fun by playing slots for hours, watching their money nose dive without it ever going back up. They want you to be furious, desperate to regain the losses from that bad streak. Make you think surely that bad streak is over now, and I'll get a big win. No you wont. Not until they take enough from you. Then they will give a little back to keep your hope up. They want you to have extreme mood swings to make you addicted, make you want to not let them get the better of you. But you will never win. They will not allow it. There is no luck involved, it is programmed to make everyone lose.",1

My address is clearly shown on all documents. Multiple live chat agents said the documents are fine and there should be no problem but that it may take 48/72 hours for security to respond to my email, with the updated documents. That was on Tuesday, it is now Saturday. I still haven’t heard anything and I’m told security still haven’t even reviewed it, despite being told it is now a prioritised case. This is not good enough.

2020-03-01,I signed up an account and got the 100 spins welcome bonus. I did the wagering requirements and ended up withdrawing 80 pounds spoke to a member of the customer service team on live chat who told me it had left their end and would be in my account within 3 to 5 days. About 4 hours later tried to go back onto my account and said it was closed due to business grounds. No in depth explanation as to what this means and they told me they have reversed the withdrawal and withholding my money and that's it. Basically they have stole from me. If this was in the street the person would of been put in a police cell and taken to court. How the hell can they get away with this kind of conning behaviour,1

2020-02-18,"PADDY POWER equals.....POOR PERFORMANCE!!. After a week of communication they were unable to verify my account. I repeatedly sent my driving licence, utility bill and a copy of credit card(with numbers blanked out!).I deposited £25, spent £1 on a game before my account was locked. PP are now returning £15....it appears they are charging me for their time. 1.I sent an email of complaint to the address listed on the website...an automatic reply saying account does not exist. 2.The ""support department"" sent an automatic email advising me to log on to"" live messenger support"" to resolve my issue. Live messenger support are only able to send to the support department. So a very frustrating loop began over the next 4/5 days with no resolution.If PP had some good PR this could easily have been resolved very nicely. Instead they have a very disgruntled lifelong ""almost customer"" (apparently among many other disgruntled customers if it take 72hours to verify an account. Other companies perform this process in minutes). In fact they were very swift at closing my account and made no attempt to retain my business. As a disgruntled ""nearly customer"" I promise to relay my story of woe to as many people as possible.I hope this gets read by someone senior at PP because I had no other way of getting a message to them.  Be wary of PP all you punters out there.I am now a very happy punter elsewhere. I am losing too much money but at least it is not going to PP. Be careful and only gamble what you can afford to lose.",1

All seems good so far! (4) £200 bet wins @ 4/6 (£333.33) (5) I Give my Ticket in and then told he put the ticket through for £100 so the return is £166.66 ie £33.34 less than the bet placed of £200 for a winning ticket!!!! (6) Complain to Customer Service and Manager and the outcome is there is nothing wrong!!! that the CCTV cameras can see?There seems to be one question that is being forgotten by Paddy Power. If the bet is not going to be honored at being struck at £200 because the cashier put it through at £100. Why is £100 of my original £450 winnings not being returned? Out of Principal, I haven't collected the bet that isn't being honored because if you want to steal £100 you might as well have the other £100 aswell.

2019-12-19,I’d genuinely give no stars if possible been using paddy power a year straight won once in the whole year they say everything is done fairly but believe me it’s not I’m a member of many betting sites and this is by far the worst. The thing is they say it’s all fair it’s not they put a winning cap on your account and genuinely mug you off I’ve played on slots live tables never ever won just lose lose lose I understand with gambling that’s the risk but someone does not lose everyday for 6 months. They don’t give no rewards for using live casinos and nothing with depositing my advice to anyone that even thinks of signing up run the other way. You genuinely have more chance of a return if you threw your money of the London eye. Don’t be fooled by the thieving *****s best of luck and happy gambling,1

I have used their help desk many times trying to get my money and initially they lied and just said that they had until the following Friday to pay me, ( whatever happened to their claim of 2 to 5 days. So I waited until Friday.....still no money. Asked again and was told that they had a problem with withdrawals on certain dates over a 4 day period..... when were they going to let me know, or any of the other customers effected? I was told by Hayley that they don’t email customers. That’s strange because They email me daily trying to get me to bet!!!! Today 2nd December, I asked to speak to a manager, but apparently “Hayley” had to read from the script in front of her, no manager available, no update on when I would get my money, although she started off saying “a few days” Then in the space of 5 minutes, she said “ a day or two” , Ending with “I have no update”  They don’t like you to say they are not paying out, but effectively that is what IS happening. When I said I would be closing my account, I was told to “have a nice day” that’s Hayley’s best effort at customer service.

2019-10-08,Used to think Paddy Power was great but if it comes to getting just £10 back you’re screwed. Basically had a blocked PayPal account they won’t allow you to change it unless you contact them. So I had contacted them previously about the issue and was told “no manager on hand to assist come back another time” with that I was annoyed and left. Yesterday after months and forgetting that my account had issues I played as normal. It came to the point where I wanted to withdraw £10. To be told I can’t until I at least deposit £40 in a PayPal account I could no longer use. So I added my debit card thinking I could withdraw using that as its direct but to add it you have to make a deposit of £5 - so I did. *Account balance £15.*Then it said I couldn’t withdraw anything more than £5 until I withdrew to either ApplePay or PayPal first. Ffs. I contacted paddy power they removed my old PayPal account so I could add a new one but failed to inform me I had to YET AGAIN make a deposit of minimum £10 just to add my paypal account. *My account balances now £25.*I go to withdraw finally with PayPal and then it said “You can’t withdraw anymore than £10 til you withdraw at least £5 with Apple Pay and £5 I with my debit card.”So I had to withdraw £10 through PayPal £5 through Apple Pay and the other £5 through my Visa card before it would then let me withdraw the last £5 to PayPal. What an absolute joke. Money laundering has probably beat this system and it’s a shoddy system but a person with what started with £10 having to add £15 more can’t even get even the basic of cash back. Ridiculous AVOID.,2
2019-10-07,Beware!! Thought I was depositing £10 but £ 40 was taken from my account I thought this was my free play money!! I tried a couple of slots very disappointed and unexciting wins were very small and not enough to keep me interested or keep playing I won't be back and seriously people find something better to do with your cash !! I know I will !!,1
2019-10-06,"So weird. After years of losing small amounts William Hill suspended my account unless I sent them selfies which I did. They weren't clear enough on my phone apparently. So I joined Paddy power who were offering £30 free bets if I deposited a tenner. I won my bet and banked £16. I then won £38 with my free bets. I banked £30 and put on some accumulaters with the 8 quid. Then they closed my account. They won't say why. How do they make money treating people like this?Tiny amount of money won fairly and they spit the dummy out.My 8 quid bets also won, pure longshots. Paddy power seems to want charitable status where we just donate them money. Avoid.Can anyone recommend an alternative that doesn't behave like this. Do all of them need me to send selfies now?",1
2019-10-02,They are very quick to stop you placing winning bets on horseracing and other sports. They are delighted to take your money but reluctant to pay out theirs.Their subsidiary Betfair is equally bad for their sports book - their exchange is marginally better where they only charge fairly significant,1
2019-10-02,Keep away from this casino paddy power you will lose all your money this scambag are mafia keep your money safe,1

2019-09-30,"Absolutely theiving shower of pr..ks.  Liars and the fk off attitude is unreal. I backed a horse to be placed in a 7 runner race so it's only first 2 places. The betting was 7/4 5/2 3/1 12/1 etc. My horse was 3rd fav and the price was 11/8 place only, which I thought was fair enough. So I wrote it down, bet accepted 100 cash handed over. My horse duley won. When I went to collect my 237.50 they suddenly told me it was not 11.8 but 2/5... I argued my point and the woman behind the counter ( who did not want to deal with This, and treated me like I was a thief just wanted me to fk off). But I kept standing my ground.  She eventually rang an advisor and they answered after 50 min.. anyway 2hrs later still nothing was resolved, even though I spoke to an advisor and he stated that pp price at 2/5 was completely wrong. By 6pm ( race at 3) still nothing forthcoming.  So I rang pp again and was on hold for 27 min. Eventually a nice girl said we will sort this and ring you back within 20 min. That was 3 hrs ago and no calls back.. what I would advise everyone is to photograph the specials or the screen where you've taken your price from. Pp answer to no one. They believe they can rob and steal from the common man, because gambling is a secretive product , we tend to only talk about the winners. I think this blatant stealing from Joe soap has to stop. We are good enough to put on our bet, they should have the ball to honour it.. ps if you ring pp within 15 sec they will answer and say "" ACCOUNT NUMBER PLEASE.. when you say you have a shop query, they say please hold and your phone will ring min 15/20 minutes. Cause they don't staff problems they just want your money.. be careful folks... robin hood wore a mask.. Gerry",1
2019-09-30,i can say that i have never had a problem with paddypower. quick withdrawals and a responsive customer service. the site is clean and easy to use,4
2019-09-28,"This is my honest review of Paddy Power Casino games based on my experience with them. For those who don't want to read on Paddy Power is okay. It's possible to win and win big, but not twice in the same night. There are some fairness issues to be raised but technically one of the best casinos out there. But don't think you will get a free ride here, you got to play Real smart and pay attention because the moment you don't you will loose money. Eyes wide open guys and good luck! For those who are interested in my detailed experience and my response to the bad reviews on pirates game I think this will be invaluable to you. The sign up process was quick and easy and I had no problems with the registration process. From filling out the online form and registering my documents, all went smoothly without a hitch.Depositing and withdrawing is a very quick and easy no hassle job. I was pleasently supprised of how I recieved my first withdrawal of £1500. within 48 hours the money was in my bank. No further documents was required either. Like some other casinos as soon as you make a withdrawal request there are loads of documents additional to the registration they require. Not at paddy Power, you are varified before you can lay your first stake.Paddy Power offers an extensive array of games that are top quality. Everything to do with the functionality, from the thumnails to the gameplay are top notch. Minus hidden caps which I will cover later. There are many promotions ongoing all the time though I have not opted into many of them but my promotions notification tab is always full. I have won a few quid and lost a few quid. If you win too much tho it feels like your account is capped and you will find it very hard to trigger a bonus. You can literally wager thousands without success. But at that point you should have stopped long ago, wait a week and you can usually go back to play as normal again. My mistake was to leave money on the account to play the next day which I did. £1300 gone with no bonus, I felt sick pressing the spin button because I knew I was capped and there was no point. I think paddypower you should remove your winning cap because sometimes we can loose a lot of cash and even one lucky streak does not balance it out especially if we are capped to only one win streak. No point denying it either you are not the only casino to do it and we all know when we are capped, its so obvious and it's bad game on your part. If you want to, you can donate your dishonest winnings from me to a charity of your choice, you have my forgiveness but not my trust. Pirates plenty, in my honest opionion this is the best game out there, people who are whining about pirates plenty obviously expected too much too soon. I have wagered over £100,000 on this game easily occross 4 different casinos and I can say I am not out of pocket. Just putting it out there that it's practically the same everywhere I played it including paddy Power, and sometimes I have done over 2000 spins before getting the bonus. I have also won the jackpot twice. My capitol to achieve this was £2500 playing at £2/spin. Little hint for you, if monkey comes he is not helping you, he is changing the position of the reels in relation to your game zone, the area which you can see. He does this so you miss the ocean spins. Stopping the reels early after he is gone usually fixes this  although he can come back multiple times if he is a really devious monkey. Note also that when the ocean spins land the adjacent reel spins twice as fast for a short period, you must make sure the first ocean spin to land is in the first 2 reels before you can spin normally or autospin. Good luck! Its not a game issue or a paddy issue you are having its your own issue. Other than the obvious caps I have experienced I still rate paddy power among the best. Definatly top 10. Maybe not 100% fair after a big win that's why I chose 3 stars and I'll give you the other 2 when you remove win caps.",3
2019-09-25,I wish I could give less stars. The company service for the company is shocking ! They don’t honour offers at all. Terrible company avoid avoid avoid,1
2019-09-22,Ok app but when in the casino in betting it just knocks off and makes u start over.that could have be a win? Big let down for a real big betting company which I use daly. Big big let down,1
2019-09-22,"Paddy power tricking customer with the lay out off the odds now, haven’t been betting on the app in a while but when ever the changes were made it makes out that a bet has higher returns ie your returns includes you initial bet, also the betting odd are deceiving as it would in the paddy says evens now it would say 1.000 suggesting that’s it’s a +bet returns. Totally misleading and the when I check with customer care they just ignored me.",1
2019-09-20,"This is a review for the pirates game. What  WAS that about.? I Spent an hour and cash to move my ship from left to right across the map. Finally got to the end ( a few minor wins in between) 8, 6 and 4 quid)    I got to the end of the map was really excited.     Wait for it    I won      NOTHING put on a new board that was worse than the original and never hit the bonus round.  What a swiss!",2
2019-09-20,"The company is sour! As I can already see.. THEY DONT LIKE WINNERS! But what do you expect from a company who makes a profit off of people’s losses to be fair? The restrictions are ridiculous though, maybe they should think about other business ventures if they are that concerned about the people who spend there money actually winning (god forbid..)",1
2019-09-19,Wish I could give this site a - 10 star reviewI have put over £400 on this site on slots and not one of the 3 slots I played gave a bonus yet I play video slots and put the same amount on and bank just under 7k in three months this site is a joke and will not give much out in bonus sense stay well clear get on video slots or netbet 100000000000000000% better,1

I'm not a high, high roller but I do spend a bit more than the average punter, and fell it is appreciated by the freebies I've received.

2019-08-24,The paddypower cash out con. Paddy Power are operating a deceitful scam in regards to cashing out on horse races. They will only allow you to cash out if the horse seems likely to win a race meaning they would have to pay you out less. On 20 horse races I was refused a cash out totalling £670 on other horses that had every chance of winning running up to the line.The amounts are offered and then when you try to cash out they do not allow you until it seems obvious what horse will win. On horses that seemed certainties to win the race they would allow you to cash out immediately. I Am reporting to the gambling commission. Felt you should all know and it would be dutiful to highlight for all.,1
2019-08-20,"Do not use this site ,many times I have opt in for promotions and they never give it to you ,they always have a excuse not to give it you .they are done it to everyone I know who as used their site .",1
2019-08-16,Hi can someone tell me have i been DONE/CHEATED I took a price of a event this week and when i checked my open bets it was there but the price i took had been changed to a lower price without any contact from Paddy Power at all in asking me.They took my bet and the next Day they changed the price on me without me knowing.Only found out because i looked at my open bets.Can Paddy Power do this I SMELL A RAT and would like to know do i have a case for taking them to Court for interfering in changing prices that was advertised without my consent.Is this a case of misleading an individual saying and doing one thing and then do another.I really do feel let down big time been with PP for a long long time now and feel they dont care about the people that has put food on all PP employees tables in the past.I know if i done what they have done on me i wouldn't get away with it.,1
2019-08-15,the worst customer service and website !!! after many years today surprise for me - my PP account is closed without any explanations and reasons. I have spent alot of money there but they closed my account without any reason !!!!!,1

2019-08-13,"Do not bet with paddy power. They closed my account with a substantial amount of money in there. I’ve been trying for 2 months to get the account re-opened, to no avail. Requested a call back from the complaint team 3 times. No call back. Every time I speak to them they ensure me some body will contact me within 72 hours. No body does! Stay away from paddy power. Bet with someone else.",1
2019-08-13,Restricted my account after i supplied them with ID evidence. That was not good enough for them so they requested more evidence. I started up a complaint through the Resolver web site. Within an hour of doing that PP the had restricted my account and refused to let me withdraw my winnings of several hundred pounds. They told me i may never be allowed to have my winnings. I kicked up a fuss when PP eventually refunded me my money i won fair and square.This company does not play fair. They don't like it when customers win. My account is s till restricted. WHY - because i win. I really would consider opening an account with this outfit. They don't play fair and treat customers in shoddy way. Finally some of the positive comments here are most likely to be here by Paddy Power staff.,1
2019-08-13,So glad to see PP with such a low score. I thought it was just me. Restricted my account when I tried to cashout just because I had not played in 4 weeks. Really? I was on holiday!!! They employ people and I think these people get incentives for witholding your money.,1

I had an old bank account on my profile so had to ring them to ask to remove it and add a new account which for some reason they deleted my card instead and said someone would have to contact me to add the bank account. Nobody called so I got a paddy power cash card so I could get my funds but when I went to use it the card didn’t work so went to login to my account for it to say the account was closed. Rang paddy power they told me my account was being reviewed and they would email me, no email 1 week later rang them again and told my account was closed on business grounds and to get my funds I would have to email a bank statement as I had no card registered.

2019-08-08,"I've received the first email from Paddy Power starting the process of shutting my account down (letter below). It's so laughable, humiliating, and pathetic for Paddy Power to do this (given how big they are) as I only bet small money; £10-£20 bets on the horses. I don't even use Paddy Power that often, I use William Hill and Ladbrokes regularly and I've taken a fair bit from them but still have no account restrictions. Really Paddy Power, for all its flashy adverts and image, has actually embarrassed themselves by removing my account privileges despite my small irregular betting with them. Email:Hi Michael, Here at Paddy Power we offer lots of promotions and concessions to our customers, like Money Back Specials, Best Price Guaranteed and free bets to name a few. However, our trading department review accounts regularly and we’re sorry to say that we can no longer offer you such promotions, from here on.

We don’t take these decisions lightly and it’s important that you know this in line with our Terms and Conditions, ""Paddy Power may, at it's sole discretion and without any requirement to give reasons, exclude any customer from the Services generally or from receiving selected promotions (e.g. guaranteed best price; bonuses; free bets; enhanced prices; and money-back specials) and any other promotions and offers introduced by us from time to time"".

Iwas blocked for basically no reason other than I won a lot more than I ever lost. They would contact me more and more with special offers until it was clear I was still winning then they blocked me.

2019-07-23,"Wow. After being a member for 3 plus years, winning the occasional bet on football and winning a bit on poker I was overall losing. I then had a few months recently where I won a few bets with good returns and also won a bit at poker. I’m only talking about £150 ish pounds up overall but still this was enough for my account to be disabled. They first asked for verification docs that I duly supplied. They then asked me for an explanation of my poker winnings, saying they suspected “collusion”. I had never colluded  with anyone playing poker and told them so. My account was still locked, they asked for more documents (a screenshot of my paypal, even tho I have never used paypal to make a deposit). I provided them with this. A week or so later after chasing them several times I received an email saying my account had been disabled due to “business matters”. They have told me that a refund for my deposit is on its way back to my card, but I will not get any of my winnings from either the sports book or the poker!!It seems that Paddy Power only want you if you do not win. Makes sense as a business model but anyone who plans to be able to keep their winnings, STEER CLEAR OF PADDY POWER",1

No where in t&cs does it state that, tried to complain, got cut off chat, next person I spoke to said it was then £2.50 I needed to deposit. Same argument of it not being in t&cs and gave up.

The following day they froze my account and wanted all my ID, Address and photos of my cards again, Even though I have been a verified member since 2010.Anyway to make a long story short, they kept on finding ridiculous reasons not to accept some of the documents they wanted off me. I just got frustrated and told them to close my account.When I was losing they were happy to let me play, when I win and withdraw they suddenly didn't want me to be a customer after 9 years!I don't really mind as there are plenty more betting companies out there. I should have raised the matter with the gambling commission, perhaps I still will. But I felt I had to give this review in the hope that prospective customers will see this and KEEP AWAY FROM PADDY POWER.",1
2019-06-22,"The paddy power cash plus card lets people lift winnings out from bank machine .. no more waiting on winnings.Pretty sure most complaints are from people that don't like showing ID online and didn't get their bonus. However, i can honestly say they are by far the best online betting company i have come across online. They have the best online casino (because it is massive and literally NO evolution gaming providers) and best rewards, too.here's a list of positives compared to other online casinos # Nice and easy to use sports page with power ups and great odds all the time.# Great promotions all over their site, sports, casino, bingo, live casino and online poker.#They have an iPoker skin.#Their Blackjack isn't invested with bots and house players.#Free spins and free bets with paddy power mean just that. You won't have any wagering requirements most of the time and if you do they will be 1x - 5x. Compared to other sites this is amazing. No 30, 40 or 100x wagers to complete.# There is no max win from free spins. Other casinos offer a bonus you need to wager 40x times then tell you max cash redeemable is £20 So the £1500 you were lucky enough to win playing free spins is £20 to you and 1,480 to them. You just do the hard work for them.#free spins are 20 or 30 spins or so... not 1,3 or 5 free spins with 35x wager and max cash out of 10 pound lol.# Pappy power have a sense of humour. They are funny, light hearted and make a gamblers smile. Great comical ads. # Excuse the fact they need your ID , all Casinos do. Look online on any Casinos review, you will find the same people that think they shouldn't have to pass on sensitive information to companies that need to act within the law. The harder you resit showing them what they need, the more suspicious they will become. That means asking for more and more even you provide what could have been enough. Your resistance, hesitation and none cooperation to provide needed identification could lead to a fall out and closure of account. Think about that!!Further update on this older review... Paddy power like to have a sense of humour which is just fantastic... but when it comes to responsible gambling they are very serious, indeed. The amount of tools available is above and beyond other sites. Activity alerts were coming into my mail box from them after a large win and the wagering from it after. Not because i lost too much, i was wagering a lot due to a large win. They were still concerned enough to email 3 times that day ACCOUNT ACTIVITY ALERT : Then list lots of options available to take a time out, set limits or even exclude. This after a huge win and wager session and not loss... so they didn't want me to lose too much money... nothing more. That is very responsible and for that i will be sticking with them as one of the few sites i use now.",5
2019-06-21,"SHOCKING EXPERIENCE!!!! Didn't get my free spins or bingo!!!

They are not daft.. they have masterminds at work here! 30 spins and one win!! Robbing company.. I'm actually appalled and feel sick to the gut regardless of it only being 30 quid wasted.

2019-06-07,Dont waste a time and money with this betting site. Me and my friends got a gub after a one week from registration. Betting site without promotion is no longer interesting for us. There are a lot of better betting site.,1

They say its a random system but its funny how the payouts are virtually non existent when they are rebuilding the jackpot 🤔. Iv played eniugh to realise the system. Sometimes 50+ £1 spins and not a dime, thats crazy lame payouts, not even a teaser the greedy sods.

2019-05-18,They have a promo on there first page on there gaming site that if you deposited £10 you’d receive £60+20 spins no where did it state that you had to join the casino before depositing the funds to get your promo so I joined a promo code was added to my join up form then I added £10 expecting to receive the £60+20spins in which it states as I didn’t I thought maybe if I started playing it would then be added it didn’t so I contacted customer services the first guy I spoke too a guy called Luca p basically called me a liar so I went back and took a pic of the first page and explained to another person called Alex to be told if I went to the casino page I’d be able to receive it there but because I’d used my funds I’d have to put more funds on to receive the promo there robbing customers left right and centre and there staff should not be calling customers liars,1
2019-05-12,Your identity upload is at risk when you upload it to Paddy Power I've done it twice now 1st time about a month ago scanning my passport when I was asked to do it again yesterday so where did it go the 1st time I did it.Update:  Now i have to prove I'm not 119 years old as there system says I am.,1
2019-05-11,Ive betted with paddy power for the past 4 years had issues but they have all been resolved quickly ive had instances where i have met the bonus requirements no bonus rqng bonus there within a couple of hours ive had a couple of incorrectly settled bets and of course wondered if i didnt ring would i have receieved it but again resolved within a couple of hours and often with a bonus for inconvienience. I have regular reviews of my account and bonus added. I prefer the bet365 betting site but love the fact i can withdraw to paypal and it be there within the hour also now have the card so use winnings direct to pay for shopping fuel etc without using bank account. I place at least 5 50 pound bets a week which gives me a free 50 pound bet on a monday this monday alone within 4 hours id won 890 from the free bet which i used for paying for kids swimming lessons direct as well as a deposit for summer holiday. I dont do slots so cant comment purely sports betting from reading reviews it just seems a lit of people moaning because they lost but that is the gamble and typical of british nature. I may eat my hat but never an issue that they havent resolved,5
2019-05-05,agree with the other negative reviewers....beware!!!,1
2019-05-01,After reading the other revews I think I'm lucky( they blocked me only £20),1
2019-04-30,This is an outright scamming company.I registered and deposited 200 GBP and placed a bet on a UFC match.I won 350 to have a balance of 550 and tried to withdraw - was told to verify. I did with all relevant documents.I was then contacted and told my account had been closed and that I would get the 200 but they would NOT pay me my winnings.So bookies can just WELCH on bets and get away with it. Paddy Power is a SCUM organisation full of utter pond life. I have contacted the independent betting arbitrators but I have no expectation - I think the whole 'gaming industry' is a corrupt melting pot of horse manure.BRING ON BLOCKCHAIN! END THESE SCUMBAGS!,1
2019-04-30,"Betting with them for several years making bets, deposits and withdrawals. Then they shut my account randomly and I can't get my balance back. Over £120 just gone. They shouldn't be allowed to operate in this way - avoid at all costs!!",1
2019-04-29,"Its good to see im not alone...Starting from the site, its so old fashioned ,yuuk.You need a magnified glas to see what its written !But half of the page ads about the bets !User unfriendly,and so disrespectful.In a process of betting they just suspend your profile...aka verify yourself even so you done it already at the start a few months ago. And in the last four month's they were accepting deposits, betting, withdrawals. Then suddenly bum, we dont have your verification :)That's their stragedy ! And thats why they never can compare with another huge betting sites. Personally , I would like to support our own businesses,even betting businesses. But in this case, good bye paddy ppwer !",1
2019-04-27,I've been through the same as most of the reviews here. Won a bet and got my account suspended. Called (spent more than 30mins) and they required me to emailed documents and all. Still won't open my account after receiving the documents. I really don't understand how can they be allowed to operate in this manner.,1
2019-04-26,They wanted me to verifi myself so I could withdraw money I had won. I sent Paddy Power the documents they wanted. A further four weeks and I am still waiting for my money. I've sent them two email reminders. Spent 1hr on the phone this morning but still no luck. It would seem they try to avoid giving you your winnings. According to the annual report The groups 2017 profit were £392M. They owe me £46.17Rgds Tony,1
2019-04-24,Three weeks waiting to get verified so i can withdraw the money i won.  They let you place a bet easily and spend your own money but paying out requires tonnes of documentation.  F-king joke will never deal with them again.,1
2019-04-24,"Terrible payouts on the Paddy Power Casino Games/Slots. Always lots of bonus promises, but it's only the very small amounts that payout out...VERY occasionally! Doesn't deliver on its promises!",1
2019-04-23,Rigged games 100%. Malta based. What do you expect?,1
2019-04-22,"More B/S about verifying account.They are fobbing people off, as your registered card address is your proof of ID, you cant open a credit card with a P.O. box etc...Just going to let my account get suspended and go to someone else. Luckily have no funds whatsoever to loose.",1
2019-04-21,"i put money into account then they locked it so i could not get my own money (not any money i had won) back from paddy power, if I had read other reviews first i would not have set up an account with them",1
2019-04-18,"They are thieves. period.I was given a sign up promotion and after completing the wagering requirements yada yada I go to withdraw my winnings (about 19 quid). then they ask for ID, proof of address and such and after providing this information; they close my account! it's actually ridiculous that a business being based on the premise of 'you lose what you lose and win what you win' and yet they can't even fulfil their end of the obligations. I then contacted them to ask for a reason, which they did not provide. They sent an email which said.. ""Hi, We’re sorry to say that we’ve closed your Paddy Power account, for security reasons. We don’t take a decision like this lightly and can assure you that it’s in line with our terms and conditions. Kind Regards,Paddy Power.""Avoid at all costs.",1
2019-04-16,"Absolutely disgusted, have been a customer for a couple of years, and had a bet on the Masters back in February, before the competition started they were offering pay-out on 10 places, I checked with them as my bet was only 6 places, and was told not to worry as they would pay out. Guess what they didn't that offer was for new customers only!!n Now there's a surprise, well they can't have anymore of my money.",1
2019-04-15,"Used wife's debit card (Joint account) when signing up as it was close to hand. Paddypower accepted the payment, took the bet, and after winning promptly suspended the account and now announce that it is not possible to use other payment methods and money is lost. Took a week of sending documents and attempting to use messenger which was mysteriously experiencing technical problems every day before I finally found a page telling me this information - Avoid this company at all costs, there are plenty better out there.",1
2019-04-12,Absolutely useless company! I have been waiting for a week for my winnings to be paid into my bank account! Customer service is non existent Quick to take our money but not so quick to payout!,1

2019-04-11,Locked my account and hell to get help to unfreeze. I am net up on Paddy Power for a while - especially on golf. When trying to access account to bet on Masters or remove cash - locked out. They push all issues to chat.  Chat takes 20 mins forever a 1st reply and when you do get a person on it - they don't answer direct questions and take hours doing so. 1 hour on chat getting nowhere - but keep pretending back in a moment. Formally complain and they won't escalate or open complaint either.  Days later get a call to just try and brush it off as a training issue. This is not a one off. Chat is just a cheap way to have poorly trained people fob you off when trying to extract money - the hassle to get money out with all the documents (pretending to be a standard check) is just another policy to hang on to money. I could open a new account with no ID. Total fake customer service.,1
2019-04-10,"Terrible company. Due to clitch on their system took almost 6000 pounds off my credit card. Initially wouldnt refund without proof of id, but then did. Still owed me some money spent over 2 and a half hrs on the phone and I then gave up. Life is too shortDo not use",1
2019-04-08,Disgusting customer service avoid avoid avoid!!! Put multiple clauses in terms to avoid paying any kind of bonus. Go to Ladbrokes and avoid these liars.,1
2019-04-08,"It is a shame that what was a very positive start quickly turned into a nightmare as soon as I won and tried to remove funds. Why? because they are happy to accept any deposits without any thing other than opening an account, but try to withdraw funds and they suddenly require several forms of proof of who you are. (photo ID, proof of address and photo's of your credit cards as proof of your right to use them). Shame this isn't something they feel should be done before taking the money (note this is only a requirement to withdraw funds not to deposit them which anyone it appears can do, without verifying your card details). my advice is there are lots of bookies that ask up front for id and not after they take your cash and you win! use one of those.Addendum:After waiting 48hrs without contact I used messaging to ask why account still suspended, told ID document not acceptable. note they waited for me to ask them! So Citizen card even though recognised by the ACPO, TSI AND SIA is not accepted by Paddy Power. (note: requested copy of birth certificate not recognised as proof of ID anymore by 90% of companies) also this will take 24 hours more to verify. all it takes is to look at it and see it is a genuine document and the information matches, that takes Paddy Power 24 hours? Also it should be noted that when I requested a copy of the official complaints procedure I only recieved the customer services email address, not the required by law document. upon pointing this out I was told my complaint would be escalated. clever that as I had not registered a complaint as of that point in time. I still suggest using any other company except this one.",1
2019-04-08,Not possible to leave “0” stars. Went to cash a winning bet only to find it had already been cashed at another location! Someone in Paddy Power made a copy of the ticket and cashed it in! Ticket never left my wallet. Bunch of crocks. Only recourse I have is to take it to the Garda. The people in the paddy power shop acknowledged that it was fraud but again would not help me. Does Paddy Power have no internal audit or follow up on this - there own employees are stealing from there customers but I guess as long as it is not from the company it’s fine. Never ever again will I use paddy power - you should not either.,1
2019-04-08,"Shame you have to leave one star and can’t leave a negative star for a useless company. Paddy Power is totally rubbish, it isn’t user friendly, nothing is straight forward on it. Used Bet 365 last year for the grand national. Thought I would try Paddy Power this year. Was promised a free £10 if I bet £10, but never received it. Got to wait 5-7 days to get my winnings. App wasn’t user friendly, it was complicated even trying to do straight forward things. Was a total nightmare trying to sort out how to withdraw winnings and got to wait crazy amount of time to get winnings. Why I don’t know. App crashed for over a hour after the race ended. I wouldn’t recommend Paddy Power to anyone, definitely sticking to user friendly Bet 365.",1
2019-04-07,"Dishonest is been nice, took my bet I won they have asked for every form of ID even tho I paid by PayPal.  I wont stop till I get what I'm owed . Just a load of cowboys avoid at all costs. Conning load of fraudsters",1
2019-04-06,"Today I registered with Paddy Power in order to place a bet on the Grand National, I only ever bet on that. I went through everything and placed £10 into my new account. Near the start of the race it started asking me for ID so I uploaded my Passport details, then it asked me for proof of address so I uploaded a recent Bank Statement, which they claim would have been appropriate. I then received another message asking for proof of address! This time I uploaded another letter from my bank WITH my address and dated the end of March 2019. Then I receive yet another message to say that my details cannot be verified with the documents that I have sent them!!!! REALLY?!!!!!!! Passport and Bank Statements etc! This has to be a joke surely????? Now it was almost time for the big race and they have already TAKEN my money from my Debit Card and now they are messing me about!! I am absolutely furious! Then this happens.... at 17:11pm I receive a message saying that they have received my ID Document (Passport) and will get back to me as soon as they can. Also at 17:11pm they have received Proof of Address and will get back to me as soon as they can. At 17:15pm the exact same message comes through. At 17:16pm ONE MINUTE AFTER the race has begun I receive another message saying that they have received Proof of Address blah blah blah.....WTAF????? Now I have not only MISSED the bloody race altogether they have taken £10 from me that I will never use to bet on anything!!!!!!! This stinks to high heaven and I want my money back immeciately! How dare they do this to people on this race day when they know damn well that millions of people like myself only EVER bet on this race once a year!! They should NOT be allowed to do this to people it is underhand and dishonest to say the very least! We should all report them for this big time!!!! They have treated us unfairly and extremely unreasonably, this process should have been made very clear to everyone BEFORE they take your money.....thieving gypos!",1
2019-04-06,Absolute shambles..I palced a 4 fold acca and it won. Paddy power settled the bet as a loser. I have rang them and spoke online chat and they have confirmed they were wrong but have yet to settle my bet correctly. They said traders are dealing with it.. Bet365 here i come.. Paddy power are terrible.,1
2019-04-06,I have today registered to place a bet on the grand national my first betting experience. I was all ready to place my bet when my account said it couldn’t verify me but they had already taken £10.00 from my card. I supplied my passport to verify my age etc and they came back and said they wanted another form of ID because when registering I had apparently entered the wrong dob which I can’t see on my account so I am taking their word for it. I then questioned why my passport wasn’t sufficient because the only other ID I have is my birth certificate with my maiden name so what does that prove??? They are not responding to my requests to refund my money as I requested a refund and to forget the registerstration because I had already gone through William hill and placed my bets with them. Can’t get through on the phone and they are not responding to my request of a refund. Why would I supply them with multiple forms of ID when they have acknowledged the copy of passport is sufficent.,1
2019-04-06,"After my account got locked, I had to open a new account which after two hours was done... and I was pleased to find that as they stated the money from my locked account was transferred to my new account. So far so good, right?I provided photo verification (which was MORE THAN GOOD ENOUGH for my account that got locked), only to find today that AFTER I deposited funds in my account that it was suspended because it wasn't verified.I have since provided TWO more forms of verification (the third very reluctantly), and my account is still suspended.Funny thing though, looking at the website via my phone in the upload verification docs section, it said that my verification had been successful after I uploaded my second piece of identification.I spoke in live chat with someone, and she said ""provide them with what they asked for"" when I mentioned the email requesting MORE identification.All I wanted to do today was put on my bets for the Grand NationalI am completely and utterly fuming. All I want to do is withdraw my funds, and close my account.UPDATE:I am now being asked for a form of verification I have ALREADY PROVIDED!",1
2019-04-06,You place your bet to earn the “ free £10 bet”. You have to put in a deposit to your account before the bet is placed and this is automatically taken from your bank account. You then place your bet and it comes up “ account suspended” now I am having to fight them to get the deposit back and still not able to place a bet. Bloody ridiculous !!!!!!!,1

I've never used the poker or bingo parts of the site but it's there if you want it.I consider them one of the more trustworthy gambling sites, they didn't require unreasonable amounts of ID and have never messed me around regarding withdrawals.The only negative thing is that I have noticed is playing slots here often feels underwhelming or borderline unfair, not that its a scam but you can go through so many spins with so little payout that I would choose a different site if you want to mainly play slots. The casino and sports sections are fine.",4

Totally bad customer service  Never again will I use them , though it had no chance of winning , it’s not the point   It is dishonest  and it was genuinely their error not mine If they are like this on something so small , what would it be like on something big   I would say avoid them.  Pretty dodgy When I told them I was not happy and will take it to the ombudsman , they read the messages but couldn’t be bothered to reply. You can see it’s read as it says so Now that is wrong.

I have not been back there since and that is after being a regular for 20 yrs.They have become the Ryanair of the bookmaking world -all mouth and no substance and still in pain from their subsequent merger(?) with Betfair. The liquidity there has been ruined, read the comments in the forum.A small consolation and a little schadenfreude for everybody, the share price is down by 33 percent and yo-yos up and down like a jockeys bum proving that what goes round comes round!

2019-01-27,"WoW! Am I glad I came on here, trust pilot I mean NOT Paddypower. Everything I knew has been confirmed, people say why would a multi million/billion pound casino want to rip off individual players for X amount? That's how they make their money, fact!In my case I was gambling big on one slot by the name of holograms wild, this has been over a 6-8 month period, after the first 6 weeks I was 10k up, playing the slot anywhere from 6-18 hours per day! (Why they let me do this I really don't know, so much for responsible gambling. I know this helped bring back old problems but thankfully I am now well rid after realising you may as well burn your money than give it to them.) Anyway, after spending weeks of your time on one slot you get to know how it spins and plays in general, so going from being 10k up to 30k down in a few months I obviously noticed, despite repeated assurances to the contrary, that it was spinning totally differently. It was not out of the ordinary for me to have session after session putting in 2-3 thousand pounds with dead spin after dead spin and when the odd 15-20 pound win came it was just suspicious to the maximum, no wild symbols to be seen anywhere then putting me on the feature bonus on 8 pound spins and winning a fiver, the same board that in the beginning had given me 5 grand plus wins, beware folks that's how they get ya!I will update this review with some very juicy stuff that I'm glad I got proof of, until then to use gambling parlance I'm keeping my cards close to my chest but please take my word for it, if you're lucky enough to have had a win and they'll actually let you withdraw it, take it and don't go back!",1

If I'd hired Spielberg to shoot the pics they'd still find fault. I was then informed I'd broken the rules by depositing from my sons Paypal account. So I asked why they allowed this at all? Surely I should had been informed before the deposit was made? But no. They wait until either you lose all your balance or if you've made any winnings, to THEN close/suspend the account.This is a common trend from Paddy Power and other bookmakers. I opened an account at another bookmakers (Where my account was suspended by GAMSTOP). They let me made deposits, was OK while I lost, but when I won and tried to withdraw my winnings, same story!There must be thousands of customers/punters out there who have been lulled into the same trap, and unfortunately for ALL, there is no solution whereby you'll have your winnings returned.

I was told by an agent it was due to a delay in their cashout system and eventhough my bet had won there was nothing they could do.

To cut a long story short 1 winner in 3 or more rooms...where does the ticket money go from the rooms who didn't have the winner? I have contacted watchdog but nothing.

Since they do not want to take a passport, it was necessary to download a driver's license. That driving license is not enough, you need to download utility bill. The check takes 72 hours, as they informed me, but after this time my account was not verified. It was necessary to write to the chat and upload these documents to the chat again. After a considerable time, I hardly verified account.I made a deposit in the amount of 300 euros and started betting on sports. Good luck smiled at me and I won a considerable amount for the country in which I live and that’s 401 euros.When I decided to withdraw funds, they returned only the deposit and said that my winnings would be withheld. They requested documents. I sent everything as requested. But, unfortunately, they said that there was a decision to close my account and take my money. I was outraged because they brazenly took my money to themselves.I repeatedly turned to the chat with a request to explain why they made this decision. To which they replied, ""The decision was final, all the best to you.""  I again contacted the support service, but without success. They brazenly took my money and closed the account.

2018-08-29,"First off I want to state that I have not been asked by Paddy Power to write this. I play on quite a lot of casinos and have been unimpressed by most. When I have looked at lots of other casinos reviews on here, I am amazed at how positive they have been and really suspect that they are either fake and written by the company themselves, or they have incentivized their customers to leave them. I certainly don't win all the time at Paddy Power and over the years I am without a doubt out of pocket, but of course it's gambling and it would be unrealistic and stupid to expect to win all the time. However, I do regularly have decent wins and have taken money out. They pay out super quick, sometimes within minutes and also when they give a bonus it's either no wagering requirements, or a really small amount. The other thing about that is that I got a message pop up to tell me the wagering was done. On another site I remember I had to keep refreshing my balance or else contact customer services to find out when it was through!On the few occasions I have had to contact their support I have found them friendly and helpful. I see that the ratings for Paddy Power are poor, and i haven't yet looked through them yet to ascertain why that is, but my experiences (apart from losses) is that Paddy Power is a fair company who actually don't mind people winning sometimes (unlike some casino's - 32Red springs to mind as they have appalling bad payouts) plus the payouts are fast.",5
2018-08-28,I deposited £10 on a sat morning and over the next few days I won a substantial amount of money about £1500 in total on a number of different sports bets I thought I’m not going to give them it all back so I have a paddy power cash card which gives u instant access to ur winning but the card I have only lets you withdraw £400 a day so I went to a cash machine to draw £400 out which all went fine the next day the same no probelem the 3rd day went to the same machine as the previous days it took the money out my account and never gave me the cash back a week on I still haven’t received my money £400 is a lot of money I’ve promised myself weather I get the money back or not I won’t be using paddy power services again as this is a total off putting experience especially with it being a large amount of cash,1
2018-08-23,"They use Playtech software for their poker site, absolute rubbish, players with highest VIP status always seem to get favourable hands and rarely get stung on the river. Side games/slots are a complete rip-off, you're never ahead in the game and constantly chasing your losses. I was adamant about cancelling my account even though the manager in their call center wanted me to take a cool off period instead. He then suggested I cancel any other online accounts I might have as if I had an addiction (cheeky bast(ard). It was more like, if Paddy Power wasn't getting my business, they didn't want anyone else getting it either.

2018-07-21,"I may well wrong, but just through observing the last few open bets, with the cash out option I had; I have noticed that games that seem to be well won become suspended, which subsequently leads to cash out option becoming unavailable. When they are taking no more bets on a certain event happening (i.e the opponents making a miraculous comeback), a grey ‘lock’ symbol appears beside it, which seems to render the game permanently suspended, and in turn makes your cash out permanently unavailable. I haven’t seen this from any other online betting companies, which would probably explain my dire betting record with them. Will be seeking to close my account.",1

Today I opted in for 30 free spins on Paddy Power and 2nd spin in lucky reels activates which can produce some big wins. Next thing you know the app kicks me off and on return to the game the lucky reels has gone. Spoke to customer service this morning and got passed around to then eventually speak to someone who just gave me poor excuses and a poor attitude. I would STRONGLY advise not to use this company as they are by far the worst bookmakers available. Rate 0/10.,1

If they wanted to they could have used the half point system like they do on the total goals market. Then there would be no arguments.

Especially my dads bets as my win is nothing to do with him, or are you scared i may bankrupt you with another massive £800 win? lol. Why limit my dads account just because we have the same surname and same ip address?.

2018-05-09,Ive played all the online betting main sites and thought with resonable promotions. and mainly low wagering that started with rewards that made me wonder why I hadnt played on here before as my main wagering is done on games and casino. Unfortunatley this doesnt last and you soon become aware that this site very rarely lets you win.Ive never seen such consistantly bad gameplay that so often seems incapable or so much harder than anything ive been on before of spinning even a feature bonus in. While on paper they probably are able to justify gaming laws I became more convinced youcan wager all day and never see anything considered a decent win. Do not stake in hope its coming eventually because it doesnt. I got to the point were probably near 10 seperate sessions made me conact support  to request this be looked into because we all understand risk and bad luck but Paddy power on top of offering zero support or customer appreciation are one site I wish had never led me in. They acted so awfully ive no faith gaming online anymore but good luck proving anything. Customer service is just a bad joke that will just fob you off or disconnect after repeating the same answer a dozen times becuase with out prompting they offer as much help as a flat speed bump. Im glad Itsa not only myself to find this reading similar reviews only confirms its not safe or fair to use Paddy Power on any structure. . Also leave as much feedback as you want it never gets addressed or responde to . Id be suprised if they even read themgiven the so called support Ive not been given,1

Total joke in that there is an option to see if there is anything Paddy Power can help you with when posting this.

2018-04-30,"I'm Paddy Power customer more than 10 years. Like spending time here, betting, paddypower mastercard is amazing bonus. Anyway now this company has no respect to customer. I made a £100 tennis inplay bet on tennis match on 2.50 odds, other bookies offered the same odds. Later my selection start to win, and paddypower offered the same  odds like other bookmakers much lower. So I did another two bets £120 and £200. My bet won and I got paid over £1000. Anyway after 1 hour first two bets were voided, and last paid £250, should be £500, because £200x 2.50. I was really surprised how is possible like that, anyway I agree that last two bets might be a paddypower mistake with odds, so I agree they can void that, but my first bet placed should be a winner. I contacted their chat about that and they immediately voided my last bet leaving in my account negative -£50 balance, than I asked to correct my first bet as a winner, they refused it, telling me that match finished 12:50:14 and I placed all three bets at 12:50:34, how is possible to place three bets at the same time? I quickly check my first bet time and it was 12:47:28. I contaced chat again, they said send this to traders, after 16 hours nothing, so I contaced chat few times again and they telling me the same story. I really feel confused about this.

If someone could have just reassured me this when I enquired it would have been fine however now I don't want to use them again. So gone up from 1 star to 2.",2
2018-04-16,This is the worst company on the planet I'm so annoyed P.P. get away with it. As I'v said previously they did me out of £24 out of my deposit of £25 a £1 bet on macilroy. They are con merchants I'm not interested in the money it's the fact that those scumbags get away with ripping punters off. Just a shower of tossers. Glad I can rely on my accounts with bet365 betfred and sky bet who are genuine firms who care about their customers.,1

2018-04-16,"The worst bookie experience I've had by far.For the signup offers be very careful, which I am and decided to check to make sure I was doing the right thing on their chat service. The representative confirmed what I said which was great. Then I back the next day to check i'd qualified for the offer and was met with a completely contradicting statement. I've used the chat service with Coral, Betfair and Smarkets, all of whom were incredibly helpful, clear and even compromising in some cases. Paddy Power's  customer service was appalling. I was even disconnected by the representative after asking a question and waiting for a response. PaddyPower lost a potential customer in me almost immediately, will never go back to them. Save yourself the trouble and find one of the many other, vastly better bookies that are available. They make it purposely difficult to find any information on these offers and this is coming from a biochemist who double checked with their representatives to be 100% sure.",1
2018-04-13,"i opened an account and placed a bet on various horses. when I tried to log in the next day I was advised I had used incorrect password. I set up a new password and placed another bet. the following day same problem again. this happened over the next few days. I was eventually locked out of the account. I was not advised what the problem was, the security staff requested proof of my identity before the account could be accessed. I wrote to the head office asking why they required more proof and had a reply stating this was policy of the company but if I didn't want to provide this I could close the account. having e-mailed five different people to close the account this could not take place until I provided more id. I e-mailed the horse racing watchdog but did not receive a reply. I assume they are powerless to act as the company is off-shore. all efforts to reclaim the balance have failed. I hope the company get ripped off by a professional backer. My secure details are my business, why the money cant be put back into the card account mystifies me. probably too complicated for the Irish brain?",1

I rang them up and was told some guff about anti-money laundering and that I'd have to submit fresh ID. They said this was because I'd failed a security question - claiming that the DOB they had for me was ""totally different"". Now I know my DOB was correct so I contacted them online next day - this time the guy told me my DOB was ""slightly different"": Clearly just a ruse to hold onto your money for longer or, as in my case, hope you bet it away in frustration.

I find I play a lot on their website but very rare do I get promos or anything for that matter! Compared with what I used to, in fact I don’t get much at all without having to stake quite a bit of money first. The site has went dramatically downhill, I contacted customer services to ask them to convert my casino points (apparently conversion rate 85=£1) as I can not do it on mobile anymore, only to be told I needed 100 points to convert which I argued with and stated that it was written underneath my balance which got me the answer of “excuse me miss I hope you don’t think I’m being rude but you think you might have a gambling problem”!!!!!! I was fuming to say the least, then I had to laugh as it’s quite a joke, the site is rubbish compared to what it used to be, there is many more sites offer bonuses etc and you don’t even need to spend cash it’s free to have fun!

Female jockey's with some being better than male jockey's as with trainer's female rolling out great horse's. I would place my bets & view race/s at home. One particular female with mouth like a sewer protected by glass (in shop) would be cussed out for errors re bets/payouts , she would delight in same abuse giggling!! I intervened a few times re the language with my being apologized to by customers. This female staff member gave me her mobile number - l was catergotic telling her to ""get her head down, work and desist arguing"" because someone could turn nasty and needless to say most machine gamblers would kick off losing big money.Unfortunately tables turned re myself & l told her to shut her mouth because when she was present her voice on par with a Banshee was off putting. 2weeks ago matters escalated ...... I was forced to call Paddy Power complaints 5 times until area manager returned call. This may sound trivial, but customers are openly declaring their dislike, amid threats hence reason she's never on shop floor for big races. I have winning slips but won't enter said outlet due to above reasons. She requires retraing, but unfortunately she is acting manager......How can PP allow same behaviour to continue? My interventions stretched to friends l made in outlet when same sworn at by this so called professional *******.

I don't understand how this is possible when the odds of hitting red should be 48%. It seems like other people have been having the same problem too.I wish I would have read trust pilot before depositing. Now I am down £100, make sure you don't make the same mistake as me.

I waited a few days as I expected PP to have a lot of people to pay out, when I went to pick up my winnings I knew they probably wouldn't have the £4750 I think it was if memory serves in cash so when they told me they didn't have it in cash I wasn't surprised, the person behind the counter then made a ten minute phone call to head office after which I was offered a cheque for that amount so I said yes as I wasn't bothered how I got it as long as I got it, so I took the cheque put it in my bank, a few days later the cheque bounced and was sent back to me so I had to go all the way back into town to the shop where the staff had to make another ten minute phone call where finally I was told to come back in a couple of days where they would give me it in cash which is what I did. The problem I have with all this is this is a multi million pound organisation yet they are giving out cheques that bounce also I am disabled and have trouble getting about I had to make two more journeys into town that I shouldn't have had to and go through unnecessary pain just because of Paddy Powers incompetence but to cap it all off there was no written apology or anything. They take peoples money instantly yet we have to waste hours of our lives trying to get them to pay us the money they owe. Personally I will never bet with them again they are an incompetent and embarrassing organisation and should not be trusted. Bet with them at your own risk.",1
2018-01-24,A once great site now ruined by a new updated web page where you cant cash out cannot see your detailed bets as prior the change and the tips section completely vanished. A once loyal customer of many years gone with their daft replies to my complaint. I certainly will be spending my money elsewhere. Pity but the moron who devised this site wants putting down along with this revised useless site.,1
2018-01-21,"Been drastic, they closed my account with £40 still in it of winnings, they said it was because one of the debit cards registered on the account was not mine, It was registered to my partner and i had her full permission to use it, i have just taken up the task again of proving that the account was mine, i am alive not a robot, i have sent all the documents they have asked for, have forwarded 8 different forms, utility bills with past and present address, medical forms with D.O.B on them, a birth certificate, letters from the MOD, letters from my bank past and present, i dont drive so no driving licence to prove it is me typing, passport 23 years out of date, oooh they were not happy with this, oh no, they asked me for anything else with past and present addresses on it to ""Prove"" i am me, it is me, i lnow its me, im sat here being me... i forwarded further proof that i do exist, i obliged, i was crying blood as i did this and my thumbs were now small stumps through typing, i was going through anything i could get my hands on, a school report from 1976 saying i must try harder, Look Miss Clarke, im trying harder, im dealing with Paddy Power, God am i trying harder, bet she still wouldnt give me a ""C"" for effort, i deseve a Knighthood for what i gone through with these people and their security, hold on, he wants one more bit of proof that the body i am in belongs to me, yes, i have it, another vital peice of info, hiding at the bottom of the black pit that i am in.. finally,  finally we can get this over with, re-open my account, get my winnings and drink them to forget the mare i have been living..will the lad say no problem Nick, all sorted, you are indeed yourself, we can see that now.....i will pass all you details on to security for review..guess what, he did..YEEAAHHHHH...     I start in the morning to prove my partner Karen (who im sure is real, as we have a child together) is real to Paddy Power... as her card is on my Paddy Power account...Im contemplating taking a Short Cut as she doesnt drive( so no driving licence) and no passport( out of date) , im thinking on the lines of having her arrested and jailed for a bogus crime and get the picture of her taken by the police sent to Paddy Power along with samples of DNA, fingerprints and an armed escort taking her to PP head quarters for interrogation...my feelings are Paddy Power will be sceptical as to her being who she says she is..(PS..Account is still closed)        Such Fun....",1
2018-01-19,"Their new interface is a backwards step from their last one. The Quick Bet feature has gone which I used a lot. To place a bet is now way more button presses and clumsy. The Bet slip also opens up about the match stats so you have to keep it closed. When you place a bet you no longer get to see the bets you have made on that game. You have to open another Tab and keep referring ""my bets"" on that tab.The only improvement is that ""my bets"" now shows you your losses as well as wins. The website is unstable and glitchy. You really can't trust the data to be up to date which is a problem if you are relying on paddy power to give you the match situation and you like in play betting.I lost money due to their glitchy website (never had a problem with the old one) and when you tell them they don't care. Customer service is just there to make you feel that they listen and care, when in fact they don't give a fig. Time to move on and try someone else.",2

2017-12-26,Paddy Power online betting site is for want of a better word CRAP the amount of times iv missed races because the site just decides that it just doesn't want to show it with no explanation or reason.

2017-12-20,"The blackjack game is completely rigged, the stats are there to see if you start to play it, the dealer seems to always have blackjack or a 10, and you start on such rubbish cars more often than not and they always finish with strong hands",1
2017-12-19,"I attended paddy power shop Address: 165 Lewisham High St, London SE13 6AA on 15/12/17. I have never in my life experienced such rude staff behind the counter. I handed my bet over for the 5.13pm at steepledowns. I had 3 selections on my bet slip with £3 win each and total stake £9. The rude member of staff kept on quizzing me saying thats 4 horses, After me repeatedly saying its 3 horses he made my bet late and its won. There was no reason for him to quiz me as it clearly said £9 stake so all he had to do was run the bet in the till. I then said im not happy and started being aggressive and rude and then said im not serving you. I asked for his name and he said i dont need to tell you, I then asked his superior next to him and she said for me to ask him. It is a complete and utter shambolic company and i can only wonder how they train the staff. When i reported this on friday 15th December to customer service i have been promised a call back by the area manager and i have chased up everyday since 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th and all i keep getting told is i will get a call back. Im very miffed now and think its a complete and utter disgrace by paddy power who claim to be a top firm.",1

Odds are a little tighter than some places but we still have a choice to bet else where if we don’t like it.The guy that’s moaning about he got less money because his horse dead heats is making no sense what so ever!! Firstly how is that Paddys fault?, secondly if you backed an odds on shot, then course you will get less money as dead heats half your money. Simple betting rules! Not hard to follow.

2017-12-10,"I am writing this review out of complete disgust in regards to the Paddy Power online live Blackjack site.I have just played 8 hands with stakes varying from £50 up to £200 and cannot believe how fixed this site is, i wrote down the 8 hands dealt to myself and the dealer.My hands were: 13, 14, 12, 16, 16, 12. 18 and 15 !!!The dealers hands were: 21, 19, BJ, 20, BJ, 20, 21 AND 19There is absolutely no way this site is regulated, it is disgraceful that they are allowed to deal themselves such hands it actually amounts to stealing as you have little or no chance of winning, it is computerised to the extent that the higher the stake you place the less chance you have of winning.Paddy Power should be taken to task over their blatantly fixed site. There is no one you can complain to, they will continue to run a fixed site unless a genuine governing body steps in and takes action.The number of 10's the dealer has as the first card is around 70 % and even when they are on 16 the number of times they draw a small card goes against every statistic out there.I will never place another bet on this site and I advise anyone even thinking about using their site to think twice it is 100% fixed and YOU CANNOT WIN so please heed my advice and stay clear of these thieving COWARDS  who hide behind dolly bird dealers !!!Thanks for allowing me to get this off my chestRicky",1

2017-12-02,Horribly uncompetitive oddsThey don't care about such things though. They're more bothered about silly marketing gimmicks and stupid adverts. Their target audience is the crowd that doesn't compare odds and does cash out.,2

In Newfoundland, Canada betting shops are illegal,so for me it was a chance of a lifetime to visit Paddy Power,betting shop.  There were two women working there that afternoon and they were the best. Their names Natalie Rooney and Joanne Bates.  I was shown how the system worked and bet on a horse race and a grey hound race.  It was marvellous,it made me feel like a kid again.  Keep up the great work and these ladies should be commended for being extra friendly,helpful and just great.  I didn't win anything but it was a blast ..thanks to both of you especially the lady who had all the patience when having to explain the procedures......because she had to explain it to me more than once! LOL",5
2017-07-20,"I have had an account with Paddy Power for a few years now and yesterday I deposited £20 to have a little flutter. As soon as I deposited my account was frozen and I was asked to send verification of who I was. This was no problem as they asked for a photo of my Drivers License, a photo of an Electricity Bill and a photo of my Debit card. They also asked for a photo of one of my other debit cards which I hadn't used for over a year and that was now void and had expired. After hunting around I found the card that had expired and sent photos of everything requested. Still no reactivation of my account, instead I am still receiving scripted emails from Paddy Power asking for the same things. What really angers me is that they allowed me to deposit £20 then ask for verification telling me that I could not have MY money back until I send photos of the information requested. I have been going back and forth with emails from the Plebs at Paddy Power, so I thought I would sign in and see if my account was activated. So I loaded a game and played with my £20. Then I receive an email asking me for the verification items AGAIN. NO WAY was I going to go through the hassle and rigmarole of sending all of this again. I politely told them in an email to close my Account. I have NEVER dealt with such shambolic staff at Paddy Power. My advice is to give them a very wide berth because they take your money when you deposit and hold it until you can verify everything they ask for. Surely it should be the other way around......verification before you are allowed to deposit??",1
2017-07-16,"God do you want to hear a tale. Right I complain a lot to companies. I started over money going missing on Paddy power. They even admitted it £27 had gone missing from my account. They eventually replaced it. Then something else happend. Their games even though mainly VF crash a lot. Their own made for PP are pretty poor. You win once then nothing. So anyway I complained this was about three years ago. A member of staff took exception to me and started sending me bulllying emails. No crap. I tried to complain but him and his mates must have blocked my emails. I'd forget it for a while. Then because I never withdrew from there except once I used to play a fiver a week to try and win money back. Sometimes it would be a bit more. Anyway never won crap. Then when they did that terrible bet on whether Oscar Pistorius murdered his fiance I wrote in furious. They didn't even defend themselves they just thought it was funny.. I felt for Reeva's parents. Their daughter was murdered and these divs doing that!! Saying that you've got to be some type of git to run a company where they take money off everyone and pay little out.  Well the emails got worse and when I rang up over missing money they'd cut me off. I wrote to their CEO ignored. Wrote to them all IGNORED. What made it much worse is I explained that I'd lost a lot of my family and was grieving could they lay off. That just made these worse. As I said I'd forget it. Eventually earlier this year someone listened. I got a small bonus to play through. Then something else happened. SO I got in touch. Ignored again. I told everyone I was going to email them fifteen time s until they replied. People in the gaming community told me to be careful. They actually banned me. PADDY POWER BANNED ME FROM THEIR SITE FOR DARING TO COMPLAIN. I ASKED ABOUT BOTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THEY BANNED ME. It happens you know if you like a site they use that ""WHEN THE FUN STOPS STOP"" campaign now. They actually have a team of people who discuss your mental health and ban you if you upset them. So I got banned from a site where I had members of staff sending me bullying emails. I did send them some to prove it but they have blocked me. Out of mischief I decided to get the big bonus recently. So I deposited my tenner got the bonus as they'd got rid of my account so I didn't have multiple ones. AGAIN MONEY WENT MISSING FROM MY ACCOUNT. I ASKED WHY AND GUESS WHAT THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT EVEN THOUGH THEY OWED ME MONEY. AVOID THESE CROOKS AT ALL COSTS. THEY LET THEIR STAFF DO WHAT THEY WANT. THEY LET THEM BULLY A GRIEVING DISABLED WOMEN (STILL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A COMPANY THAT PLACES BETS ON MURDER TRIALS??) Then when she dares to complain they just ban you. They owe me money lots of it. Never got it. They lied to me, and when I proved that I had the emails off their staff they blocked me and closed my account. What do you think of that? I'm going to start a campaign soon. To get that when the fun stops crud looked at. It's not used for the right reasons to protect players who may be spending their mortgage. No that's encouraged. It's there to shut up troublesome customers who ask awkward questions or dare to object to their horrible ways. A HORRID COMPANY AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They think much more of their staff than their customers. Which would be a good thing except the staff are pretty horrible to everyone. There's loads of better online sites out there.

2017-07-14,"For All other fellow gamblers out there:Please be aware of the following Rule at PADDY POWER…1.	If a player or pairing retires or is disqualified in any match, the player or pairing progressing to the next round (or winning the tournament in the case of a final) will be deemed the winner. This only applies to the Match Bettingmarket, all other markets are void. When this occurs before the conclusion of the first set, all bets not already determined, including match betting, are void.Paddypower are the only bookmaker who “PLAY UNFAIRLY” by this RULE??",1

Cash out isn't the best as very slow but you place a bet to win not to cash out. Only negative is PADDY POWER lose a lot of fixtures especially for tennis when they should be voided like betfair. So be aware of T AND C before placing so you're not surprised. Very slow to put bets on and can be frustrating but I still recommend highly.",4

2017-07-01,Worst ever experience.,1
2017-06-26,"Have had a paddy power account for about 5 years now, when I first joined I found the site to be very fair in terms of loses and wins, but in the last 3 years I've had nothing but continuous loss after loss, as a person who puts down a lot of money you would think I would win a substantial amount at least once! Nope, not even close! I've estimated that in the last 3 years I've lost well in excess of £45,000 and won maybe, £3000 of that back! There bonuses are far and few between and if you do get a bonus it's usually where you have to deposit a certain amount of money first. Paddy power does not value its customers and there games are definitely not randomly generated as they like to state! I know several people who hold/held a paddy power account who all say the same thing as I do! This company is disgusting and shouldn't be allowed to operate, I understand that with gambling you have to expect losses but you should also be able to expect a win from time to time, not with paddy power though, it's just loss after loss. The last time I deposited money I deposited £500 at a £1 a spin, so that's 500 spins! In all those spins I hit the bonus ONCE and only won £10!!!! I've now completely closed my account and shall never open another paddy power account again! If you have no problem with constantly losing your money and just throwing your money at daylight robbers then this deplorable company is for you, however, if you have any sense you will completely AVOID this theiving disgusting company at all costs!!! By far the worst company I have ever had the mis pleasure of dealing with!",1

Honestly, their customer services people that I spoke to have to be the most unsympathetic, most customer un-orientated people I have every spoken to. They hung up on me in the end because I was insisting that this fraudulent account be removed. They refused because I 'couldn't answer the security questions.' They should be ashamed. Vultures who victimise the innocent, how many suicides are they responsible for amongst the most vulnerable in society? I will be lodging a formal complaint.

2017-06-18,"Their slot games are faulty. Been a poker customer for a number of years, only recently started playing the odd game of slots via the poker app but one of these, at least, is buggy and crashes while steeling your money at the same times. For example, while playing a error message would sometimes pop up and state the account had insufficient funds, even though it does have funds. The app would restart and when you log back in the money would disappear. I started to take screen shots because I thought it was me at first and also so I could prove it wasn't. So when it happened again I took a screen shot quickly capturing the error message and you can see clearly I still had £20 in my account, displayed in the bottom left of the screen. It was only £20, small change but they wouldn't budge and were adamant that I didn't have any funds. Even though I was watching each spin and sent them the screen shot when this error happened again.  It happened a few times and there are other type of bugs too (i.e. You may think you won a bonus but it's not always credited to your account, all have one thing on common, taking your money unfairly.  (I have screenshots of these too, one bonus round robbed me of £70 stating I won 70 but didn't actually credit my account)And each time I reported it ( 3 times in total) they denied any wrong doing, so after the 3rd time when they robbed me for £20 and again refused to investigate/acknowledge I requested to close my account. They were happy to close my account quickly without  investigating these issues with their IT or developers. (I have screen shots of the live chats requesting to escalate but no one got back to me). In conclusion I couldn't and wouldn't trust their apps, with more honest and fairer options out there and better customer service I will not be using any of paddy powers services or products again on principle. If I could attach the screen shots of these errors to this message I would but I can't, happy to send to anyone if requested. They really should be reported and investigated by the gaming commission. I wonder how many others have had the same experience? Who checks these apps are actually working within regulatory guidelines? I asked them for an audit trail of my gaming and they wouldn't provide me with one. The irony is that they could have taken my money the honest way via the game play itself so why they want to steel it from me unfairly and lose a customer over it is beyond me. Play these apps at your own risk as evidence like screen shots and time of error wasnt enough to prove their app was faulty. They don't seem to care or have any interest to investigate these bugs properly and throughly.",1

2017-06-11,Terrible company. Once you start winning you are banned or heavily restricted with them! Paddy Power should lose their license to be a UK bookmaker as they clearly are not one! Any UK bookmaker that refuses or restricts a punter's bet should not be allowed to continue just because that punter has a winning account. Ban Paddy Power and do Britain and all punters a favour!,1

2017-05-10,"Where can I start? I totally agree with the reviews about slots, if you are fortunate enough to win don't bother playing again as they will recoup everything you won and more. It's amazing the amount of spins I have had at low stakes which have never yielded a feature, in fact I believe that they must use some kind of software to prevent you getting the feature after you've won on a previous day. I've had the third icon for the feature 'ghost' so many times. It is definitely not random and you will get the feature sometimes quite frequently if you haven't won for a few days, but I found that the majority of wins were always ridiculously low. You'd get 20+ spins with a x10 multiplier and end up getting £1.40 or similar. It's outrageous. I almost never was in profit 2 days in a row and that shouldn't happen if it was truly random on a game with supposedly 95 rtp. The in play sports betting is bad as well, including the mysterious disappearance of the cash out option or the suspension of a match not listed which means you cannot cash out. Their odds are generally poor compared to other bookmakers but by far the most infuriating thing about the sports betting section is the phantom goals that are a constant feature. It seems that they have trigger happy people working there who show goals having been scored and then a minute later we're back at 0-0. This happens far too often. It's a poor site, the slots payouts are an absolute joke and rigged in my opinion and the sports betting and in play are non league standard. Avoid!",1

2017-05-02,"I closed a Paddy Power account a few years ago as I wasn't using it enough, but fancied betting again, so opened a new account and deposited £50 on 28/04/17 and played around on the roulette.  Within a few spins, I was up to £450 so did a big spin and it came in.  I was now up to around £950 and thought I would go for a huge spin, which could change my life if it came in.  And to my delight, in came my best number, which got my balance up to £10,465.00.I was in heaven and made a withdrawal of £10k which would pay off my car loan.  But to my utter shock, Paddy Power refused to pay out saying I was not allowed to have another account and that there rules meant I could not be paid out.  They refunded my initial £50 and refused to honour the remaining £10,000.Surely this can't be right and there must be something I can do to challenge this.  So a word of warning to anyone who opens a new account having had one in the past, you will not get paid out, although they will let you deposit and play on the roulette and make sports bets, you just won't get paid out if you win.David Drewitt",1

2017-03-13,"So I placed a bet with paddy power. Spurs v millwall fa cup quarter final. C. Eriksen to score first, spurs to win 5-0. £10 stake at odds 60/1. Eriksen scored first and spurs lead 2-0 at halftime. I logged onto my account at halftime interested to see how much the cash out figure was going to be. Once I selected my open bets, highlighted in green ""won"" £610. Therefore the bet was closed and no cash out figure had been quoted. Happy days...or so I  thought. The game finished 6-0 to spurs. No money was credited to my account & paddy power deny any knowledge of ever updating the bet to ""won"" £610. Be careful it seems to me that they knew that they would have to offer a decent cash out figure in the second half so therefore negated my bet at halftime & a bookie being bookie took the chance of the game not finishing 5-0. At this time paddy power claim that in la liga, champions league & premier league games if your team goes 2-0 at anytime they will pay you as a winning bet. This does not include the fa cup. I am assuming that my account was updated to ""won"" £610 in error. The frustrating part is the fact that they took away my ability to cash out for the rest of the game including when spurs went 5-0. This option I would have considered....but didn't have to as I had ""won"" £610. Racketeers...steer well clear.",1

I resent this as for 15 hours they said they hadn't received it. I chased them by phone and email on several occasions. My account was suspended. No replies were received from PP. Totally ignorant. I have just received a reply were they stated they can see no wrong usage on the account and for me to contact the police. Also when I agree no action is needed they will unlock my account.I replied that I would not be using them any more.I believe their systems have been compromised.I also saw another account has complained about hacking.From mine and other complaints I suggest as many people as possible avoid Paddy Power at all costs.",1

Having said that, I've lost far more than I've ever won with them.This morning receive an email saying I could no longer participate in any promotions at all.

2017-02-11,"I have been a customer of Paddy Power for 4 or 5 years and to be fair have never had an issue before a few weeks ago.  I normally play the online slots and was lucky enough to get my winnings up to over £1000 so I withdrew them to my account.  Now I've made withdrawals of £500/£600 before with absolutely no problems so didn't expect any this time either, and they're normally pretty quick, sort of 2-3 days.  So I checked my account and there was no money deposited, no need to panic so I waited the maximum time stated on their website (5 working days) still no money.  So I contacted them by email to ask if there was any issue I should be aware of.  12 hours later, no reply to my email.  So I decide, I'll ring them and find out.  I am told that there was a problem with withdrawals on the date that I happened to make my withdrawal request.  So far it has been two full weeks, I have spoken to 5 different people by phone and sent (I've lost count so this is an estimate) 40 or so emails about it.  Keep being told they are working to resolve the issue but basically it comes down to they couldn't possibly care less.  You know you're in trouble when the customer service people start quoting their terms and conditions at you.  I was not aware that they had such a bad rating on Trustpilot but I would urge anyone thinking of using an online gambling site to look elsewhere.",1
2017-02-08,"I should start by saying that I have held an account with Paddy Power for well over 10 years, and in that time never really had any major issues..  I am a casual punter, and have placed the occasional bet mostly each week on the weekend football, or during the Cheltenham/Royal Ascot.In terms of my success, like most other punters, I have lost more than I won, but it was harmless and provided a little bit of entertainment.Recently, a moth or so ago, my luck changed, and I had 3 or 4 bets which came in consecutively..  Now bearing in mind that previous to this I had been on a losing streak of about 20 bets, then you wouldn't think this to be a problem.. Also, the pay-outs themselves were relatively small, the largest being a little over £200.However, this didn't stop me from getting an email from Paddy Power stating..-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for your play with Paddy Power. Having reviewed your account, we regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are no longer offering you any free bet promotions, double odds bonuses or enhanced prices. As part of our Terms and Conditions, Paddy Power reserve the right to exclude customers from promotions. This decision has been taken after careful consideration and will not affect your ability to bet on our Sportsbook or any other Paddy Power product. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Needless to say I was surprised, and more than a little upset.  I'm not particularly concerned whether I never use them, (or any other bookmaker) again, but this sort of email insinuates that I have somehow done something wrong or committed some sort of offence of their rules..I was straight onto their customer services, via ""Live Chat"" to try and establish exactly what was going on.  What had I done wrong?  Was I really being penalised for winning a few measly bets?  What about the other 90% of my bets which had lost previously?I was simply told by a ""robot"" on their customer services team that it's down to their traders discretion, and that no further explanation could be given.  I was also told that this was now a permanent arrangement, and would be enforced pretty much forever.When I think of how much I have lost down the years, it seems a strange decision to revoke these special offers which are part and parcel to everyone else.  Especially as they probably would have got my little winning back, and more so as my inevitable bad luck would have kicked back in at some point..So there you have it.. Sign up with Paddy Power and enjoy it whilst it lasts..  Just don't let them catch you winning!!!!",1

At 10:25 Pm i went on chat talking with Alan telling hime that i need the bet to be settled so i can place my money on something else. I talked with him on lenght and he wasnt able to help me. I dont even know why they have customer service. I was not able to place the last 3 bets until 23:59 so all my work was for nothing and all because of how bad this company it is.

2017-02-02,"Right, I've been a PP customer for 4 years and in that time lost well over 100k - I'm what they would call a good customer, or what you would call...a mug.Anyhow, something very strange happened Sunday night just gone and it has lead to my coming to the conclusion I will never use PP again.Lots people write posts on here about losing money...it's not fair, boohoo. In short it's your choice, no one else's, what happened to me however defies belief.Sunday I logged in on my phone and noticed that £50 had disappeared from my balance, upon looking at my account history it showed as being transferred....nothing else.Obviously I instantly called Customer service and raised the issue and was told that it had been transferred to the Poker section....strange as I never play poker and was actually laying MArio Kart on the Wii when this supposed transfer and gameplay took place.Now, the cynics will think that I just lost £50 playing poker and I'm a sore loser......I lost £3000 online last week with PP, I'm not about to try and falsely claim £50, trust me.Anyhow, I get sent a form and fill it out and return it, it says a 48 hours turnaround. Fast forward 4 days and still nothing, account still frozen, money still missing, no update other than 'It's with our security team'The weirdest thing of all, no one knows my PP login information apart from me. I only ever play on my Mac or iPhone, my phone was in my pocket and my mac was locked in my empty house (and I've checked the history just in case of remote login) and it's clean.Whomever accessed my account did the transfer at 19.16pm and then waited 45 minutes to start playing and then played for 20 mins before stopping and leaving a balance of 18USD.Even if they had won the money would have been credited back to my bank card or been withdrawn by my PP CashPlus card.....both of which were in my wallet.There was a balance of £400....so why they only transferred £50 is again very strange.The conclusion is that PP have not stuck to their turnaround times and are offering terrible customer service, I will be going elsewhere from now on.",1

Promo code turned out to be fake (google is full of fake Paddy Power codes for some reason...). So I asked Customer Service to delete the new account. He says fine. But he ends up deleting both accounts so I can't login or bet!So I went back to CS to ask them to reactivate my original account as this was not what I had asked for, and could not place any bets.3rd CS assistant says fine, but he has to contact management which could take up to 24 hours. Which meant I might not be able to place my bet. And he says I can't open a new account to bet in the meantime.This is before I have even deposited any funds or placed a single bet with any account. And they're not letting me bet in the meantime.Wasted over an hour for nothing. Never had such headache from William Hill, Unibet or Betfair.

In reality, they stop offering you free bets after a certain length of time. Their current tagline is ""You're Welcome"". That really means you're welcome to win a little, but lose a lot!

They said I breached the rules of duplicate accounts but how was I suppose to know if I wanted to start betting I had to reopen the account I closed a long time ago?,1

2016-10-13,"This bookmakers is the most duplicitous company you could ever have the misfortune to get involved with. They close your account if it shows to be winning. The free bets are stopped immediately the punter wins. Stake money is withheld on postponed bets until the punter requests it back. The roulette game in my opinion is programmed to follow the pattern of play to determine that you cannot win.The guy in the advert wearing the green coat, answering ""complain away "" sums this bookie up. Keep well clear.",1
2016-10-11,"Had a bet with PP last night. I had already backed Greece to beat Estonia that morning. The game had started and better odds of 10/11 were on offer, than my earlier 8/11, so I stuck £100 on. Then, at half time, I check my bet and the score, Greece were 1-0 up. However, PP had decided that they would change my odds! Now at 1/5, my reasonable risk to make £90, would only pay £20!! Who would risk that?! They now claim that the odds offered were wrong as Greece were already leading! How is that my fault?! And what would happen if I lost? I bet you'd gladly take my £100 that I would not have risked for £20!! Disgrace! The bet was accepted and placed, if you made a mistake, you hold your hands up, admit it and do the honourable thing! I'll bet elsewhere in future!",1

Everything was ok until the moment when wanted to withdraw some part of roll.Then came checks of ID which was already checked before opening an account, they wanted photo of my bank card, screenshot of my skrill account and utility bill. As I dont receive bills (my father did), I sent them a bank statement to check my adress. That was not enough, then I sent a ton of papers from bank with my adress, nothing was good enough. Even that that on our official ID-s and passports  in Croatia is written the adress is not enough to confirm the adress.After that problem was with picture of my ID which is scanned with 300dpi in colour. No good.Good is only if you leave funds there and go away.RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS ROBBERS!!!",1
2016-09-28,"I've been with PP for a few years now on and off, and have had a few annoying occurrences, but today's way the final straw. I don't recall the reason why I stopped going to PP in the past, but this time it was because they stopped offering double odds on a lucky 15 single winner. I mean really? Even crappy Ladbrokes give double odds and they are terrible. A small thing like this has lost them my custom, and according to Google, the custom of many others. Their live chat said it was a top level decision (well duh), but did not know why it had been made. I refuse to believe a ""renowned"" bookmakers had to cut costs by doing this, especially since they have very few actual shops and operate primarily online with little overheads. Such is the modern way of doing business: screw the customer if it saves a few quid!I don't gamble much but PP has always been my preference, until now. I'm done with them. Once Ladbrokes (the worst bookmaker in the UK) offers better deals than PP, I know things are bad.",2

I would say my issues are nothing compared to some on here. Just remember people get what comes to them. Don't let this company affect your life. You are in control of everything in your life.

2016-07-26,"I recently placed a bet which was voided.The bet was a specific Tennis Match Over 26.5 Games; priced at Evens.The Match entered the 28th game and one of the players conceded so Paddy Power Voided the Bet.I asked them politely to review and settle this fairly.I was communicating to the Live Chat people for over 24 hours, with a different person each time. 6 representatives in total. The following was stated by the Paddy Power representatives:""This bet has been voided in accordance with our Rules regarding Tennis. These were updated in March of this year and can be found at the following link:""So I now understood that the betting Rules regarding Tennis with Paddy Power were changed in the month of March 2016. Unfortunately, I was not aware of this change or other changes. I politely requested Paddy Power to provide me with the email or other forms of communication that Paddy Power specifically informed me of this and other such changes? The following was stated by the Paddy Power representatives:""Our Rule changes regarding settlement of specific markets are not communicated across to every customer as not all customers avail of betting on tennis.""How can these bookmakers change rules without email their customers to highlight a change.It was very frustrating dealing with their toothless apologies and their lack of customer service that I finally decided to close my account.",1
2016-07-26,"Good all round, mobile site needs easier site management. Seems sometimes you have to go around the houses to get where you want to be. The older site seemed better but the new one makes betslip use easier and quicker. A little more development and your on for a winner. Open bets need to be more accessible with links straight to a game from the open accumulator and details of how your bet is getting on, half the time you have to check the score of the match from the in play menu then go back to your open bet and try remember the scores and who you have bet on. Despite all this negativity the site is really good, a min deposit of 5 is brilliant as no where else does that. PayPal withdrawals take 10 mins not 24hrs, even on a Sunday. Therefore your winnings are straight into the bank. The bonuses are good if it's not a free bet it's free spins, spend enough enough. Promotions are good, this year's hotshots was a fantastic idea.  So overall I would say it's a great betting site, I use this more than any other although there's room for improvement.",4

There was no way to update it.I was then told by Customer Service that no withdrawal can be made from an account if the balance was over 200 pds. When I asked how I could reduce my balance to 200 pds when I am unable to withdraw the response was ""By losing it by betting"".I was also told that until my account was under 200pds my debit card could not be updated.In other words the policy at Paddy Power appears to make it VERY difficult to withdraw winnings and only then if the balance is 200 pds or less (any extra has to be gambled away).",1

2016-07-09,They took my money and refuse to pay winnings. Check the terms and conditions.They can close your account at any point and refuse to give a reason resulting in you losing any money you have bet and any winning.They know that a lot of people won't chase it so they get to profit from those that don't keep calling them over and over. Eventually you end up having to seek legal advice. Many people won't go this far chasing their winnings so they keep it all. Those that do chase it could be calling their untrained customer services and heartless security department for weeks It's the colours thing to an online scam I have ever come across.The gambling commission need to step in and shut this company down for their online activity,1
2016-07-02,"I thought I would warn you all before you do business with Paddy Power.I am in a dispute with Paddy Power after they failed to activate my telephone self-exclusion request in time and I and then without my knowledge, a family friend went on to spend funds in the account.My argument is that my consistent betting pattern up to that point had been to always withdraw winnings and I had not once cancelled withdrawals, and this would have stayed the same if the customer service agent had done their job.They continuously keep refusing to refund me the money.Timeline of events is as follows:On 7 November 2015, I won over £7k and had a balance of £15,078.53I processed a withdrawal.As Internet was down contacted Paddy Power to self-exclude.I was told that their system was down momentarily, but self-exclusion would be activated within a few moments.Paddy Power say they cannot locate the call, however my phone bill shows I made the call and by processing the withdrawal, logically I think it seems like a logical intention.Even one of their customer service agents called Patrick said it is not impossible for the call to not have been logged and or recorded by a customer service agent and or their systems not to automatically log it.If it was activated, I would not have been able to log on a few hours later and place a bet on Man City beating Aston Villa the next dayThey keep referred to a separate Account Takeover query I had.What happened is that family friends visited and my account was left open. During that time some of us went to the shop and another had placed some bets, cashed out some and then when he lost a lot he panicked and self-excluded.I did not find this out until after I phoned Paddy Power asking them to investigate an Account Takeover.I addressed this but there also using that as a bit of a distraction as this is separate from my claim of the account self-exclusion not being activated.I'm pursuing this now as I've been in gambling centres to wean me off gambling, but believe I should pursue this as I feel Paddy Power breached 20.1. Responsible Gambling by not immediate activating my telephone request. I fulfilled my obligation as a problem gambler by adhering to 20.4 and contacting 08000 565 275 'using the contact information on the bottom of this page.'I have talked about the huge distress I am facing - Now longer able to sleep, eat much, suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts but they don't want to know.My medical history shows I have a history of anxiety / suicidal thoughts;I also feel my betting decisions were compromised by my mental health, job loss and two bereavement in nine months:I explained how this is monies I would have withdrawn anyway and in the grand scheme of their revenues, it is not a lot, but they don't want to know.My concern is either that they are deliberately hiding this to avoid paying and or won't admit they can make a mistake.After all Paddy Power has made mistakes before like failing to notify customers for four years about their amount being hacked and being fined over £200,000 by the Gambling Commission for weak anti-money laundering policies, and encouraging a gambler to continueI tried to reason with them to reach an amicable settlement as it is monies I would have had and avoid greater costs and also negative media coverage for them, so I can go my separate ways, but they have rejected this.I even offered the unusual step of offering to pass all monies earned over my lifetime to them in a will as I am a single man and having a relationship and kids is something that I know is not for me. This is to show my sincerity and how strongly I feel about the case.I know I placed the bet, but away from gambling which I no longer do, I am really responsible with money, buy the essentials, don't go out or on holidays, buy gadgets and rarely shop for clothes.Avoid them!",1
2016-07-02,"AVOID at all costs, I am absolutely disgusted in the what Paddy Power have done.

I have contacted them complaining and they say my bet has not changed, i then remember that i spoke to Tim on the 1st of July and he comfimed my bets as i was logged out of my account so i requested these conversations, they sent me these via live chat but they removed the part about him confirming. It was only a £2 bet but this is out of order they should not be able to get away with riping incident people off.

2016-06-12,"I am currently abroad for a few months, and the betting service that I normally use was not available where I am at the moment, so I came across Paddy Power because I wanted to place some bets on the Euro Football matches.The website tracked my location, allowed me to proceed and sign up for an account, deposit £10 and place two bets. I then closed my phone and waited.Even though I'd have lost some money, I decided to cash out after watching the match, but the website blocked me and told me I was out of the territory. After so many attempts to log in, they disabled my account completely, demanding identification and everything in which I cannot show as I am away until August. So I contacted customer services on the chat, explained everything to him and he was throwing it in my face that the terms and conditions state that I am unable to gamble in certain territories. My argument was that they allowed me to sign up knowing where I was and tracking my location, and allowed me to place the bets.He continued discussing the terms and conditions and how I agreed to them. I threatened to contact the bank where he still didn't feel threatened. So I screenshotted the terms and conditions and showed him that it was actually Paddy Power who were breaking the conditions allowing me to sign up in another territory. He disappeared and then told me he has refunded the money..Don't let customers sign up in another territory if you're later going to block them once they deposit money. It's an illegal practice and if they are going to treat customers like this then it is illegal. I was lucky, but other people might not be. So avoid!",1
2016-06-06,"i do like a bet and i must say from the 3 other accounts i have with betting sites this so far seems to be the worst odds.PP claim the there roulette,black jack systems are extensively reviewed by a governing body.so let me give you an example of my findings as a player.deposit £600- covered 6 numbers at £10 stake per spin.result = after 58 spins @£10 it landed on the lowest possible win.changed betting style = deposited a further £500 placed a single £25 chip on 20 and covered 5 other numbers with with 50ps & £1 total stake £30 per spin.first 3 spins were 1 1 and 1 then the following 2 were 3,3 then result was 1 , 3 at this point i thought ok 1 last go i covered 35 numbers with 50p chips and random £1 chips and left 0 with no stake and 0 came in.With promotion points gained for my losing spins i played the same 6 numbers and i won the first spin = 50p stake (the same number as my first ever win)i then decided the law of averages one of my 6 numbers should come in (long story short a further £3000 later 3 of them 6 numbers never come in (only the small stake numbers come in after excessive betting)outline experience1) £4600 deposited  2) £360 highest win after £3.6k deposited3) excessively repeated number results 4) rolling back through the game (recorded) resulted 42 red results in a row and interestingly 5 of those repeated 3 times within 24 spins.5) out of over 263 spins all of my high stake numbers never come in.6) Total winning bets in order was 6 result of   £18 / £72 / £18 / £18/ £54 / £360 7) 32 , 14 , 20 , 18 never come in over 263 spins.8) after this PP have sent me a really good promotion upto 25% boost on any winnings on casino !!!!!! lolregulated and moiniterd you decide !!!!",1
2016-06-02,"I placed a basketball double with Paddy Power - over 147.5 points and over 163.5 points. Later, I checked the scores and found they'd both come in with 153 and 165 points respectively. When I log into the Paddy app, it states that both legs lost.Contacted them to ask for this to be sorted and was told that the double I had placed was over 147.5 and 165.5. They claim that the odds spread changed a few seconds before my bet had gone through (meaning that with the time delay it was impossible this could have happened without me getting a message to inform me of the price change) and that there's nothing they can do. They said I would have had a message to tell me about the odds change; however, this did not happen. Since their mobile app doesn't show the points spread on open bets, they can effectively claim whatever they like and there's nothing I can do to prove otherwise. When I push ""customer services"" further regarding the irregularity of the app stating both legs lost when even they accept one won, they blamed it on my mobile device!! It's apparently my phone's fault that their app is showing that a bet lost when it actually won. I told him I would take my custom elsewhere, and he was not interested in the slightest. Disconnected from me after that with no resolution. Absolutely awful customer service and a company you can't trust. Avoid them.",1

2016-06-01,I placed a bet in running (horse racing) at odds of 6-1 just as the horse I backed started to move forward.  A dialogue box then appeared stating that there may have been a problem placing my bet but to check my account to see if the bet was accepted.  The horse won.  I checked my account and the bet had been taken but then suddenly the bet amount was added back to the account and the bet was not accepted.  Obviously PP had originally taken the bet but when the horse duly won they refunded the bet to my account as if the bet had never been taken.  I complained via there live chat but to no avail and the customer service guy could not get off the line quick enough.  This can only be described as cheating and I suggest nobody ever tries betting with this lot ever if they are looking to be dealt with fairly and honestly.,1

2016-05-21,App is slow. Screens do not load by the time you get to add teams or horses you have waited that long the odds change. Irish lottery always has load problems also you would think a big betting company would have an app that works.,1
2016-05-20,I was abroad so no local betting office and wanted to place a bet on a couple of horses in The Grand National. Had problems trying to place the bet online  - maybe i wasn't putting enough money on or too much of a novice to work it out . Anyway I gave up and I have now closed my account with a cost of £3 to myself. As i only bet occasionally it has not worked well for me. I wouldn't have minded so much but  one of the two horses i wanted to place a bet on won the race.,3

2016-04-29,"My husband had a £10 bet on Leicester to win league - it was October and they were sitting top. One night  he noticed  his account with PP had slightly more money than he thought, so checked and discovered his bet had been cashed out for  £7.50!  From  a tenner!  Why would he?   He called their customer service, who told him he had done it himself,  or ""someone"" had logged in using his details and had cashed it out.  For what benefit he asked??  The money goes into his account!   They were not interested in the slightest.   He bit the bullet and  bet again - at much reduced odds.Well, what d'ya know!  It happened again!

2016-04-09,I wish I'd seen these bad reviews before betting on the Grand National with Paddy Power. Like many people that bet on the National its the only horse race we bet and usually use a high street bookie. Unfortunately we decided to use the online site instead. Our winnings were only £8 however there's a £10 minimum withdrawal threshold that wasn't made clear BEFORE the bets were made. Given that electronic transfers cost pence to make this is a totally unfair term. AVOID,1

2016-04-07,"I'd never bet with Paddy Power again - I had 2 bets on Leicester to win the  premier league, which got cashed out by someone unknown last week and not via my computer. It was either by someone internally in Paddy Power or my account was hacked. After I brought the issue up with their ""customer service"" they didn't want to know. I contacted them within an hour of it happening and stated I never wanted the bets cashed out (I would never cash out a bet anyway - I've never seen the point). I reiterated this to them for the next few days (and before any Premier League games were played). Luckily I only bet a few pounds at a time and this cost me <£10 in winnings (assuming Leicester go on to win the league). Apart from the suspicious activity in my account, I can't understand why they would not re-instate the bets, when I brought the issue up within an hour of it happening.",1

Hollywood poker flops to encourage betting on every hand with full houses and flushes  five or six times out of every 10 hands..... I'm trying to find a poker site that has realistic gameplay to rival actual live poker playing and not this ridiculous situation of simulated action on every hand which is completely ruining poker.... Coming from playing online to playing live is ruining my real game... Online when your in a showdown and your hand is seemingly strong, 7 times out of 10 your opponent will have you beat.... so when you play live poker your reads are normally clouded from being used to getting normally beat with outrageous Hollywood hands, and it ruins your game.. your more easily bluffed and lay down more...

2016-03-23,"A disabled member of my family set up an account and ended up winnings of c£40. when she tried to withdraw the money, they suspended her account and stated that they needed age verification. Ok fair enough ( however they are extremely quick to take the bet). They then stated that they needed 3 forms of ID, - utility bill, bank card and driving licence/passport, however the member of my family being disabled cannot travel (due to her disability). Therefore we sent over her disabled badge and a copy of a prescription that had her age on it. They then wouldn't accepted, then some bright spark told us to send her birth certificate, which we did, then it was refused because the surname didn't match which is no surprise because how many people do you know that get married at the age of ""0"" !!!. We then asked what they could do to help and basically other than getting a driving licence or passport there was nothing they could do. Instead they deposited the £10 initial bet and kept the rest. Whilst I admit it is not masses of money it is the principle - utterly utterly disgusting with there refusal to help. Just wanted to let yo know the type of company you are dealing with",1

2016-03-13,"I placed a bet with Paddy Power at the beginning of the football season, the bet was part of an offer they were running. The offer involved placing £20 on a top scorer and each time the player scored I would receive a free £2 bet. This offer stopped mid way through the season and no explanation offered. I spoke with a representative over Paddy Powers live online chat service. That was most unhelpful. The representative could not tell me why the decision had been made and would not give me details to speak to a manager, his response was that they to would not give me an explanation. I then escalated the complaint to the escalation complaints department. They responded by telling me it was a business decision and they didn't have to tell my they had made it. Terrible customer service. It's actually frightening that they can do this. You could win a bet and they could decide to not pay you. I would advise anyone to stay clear of this company, there are far better betting companies available, ones that won't lie to you and treat their customers with respect.",1
2016-03-13,"In summary: They took money for a bet, failed to provide a receipt and then closed my account when I complained keeping both the bet money and a credit balance I had in the account. Nothing short of fraud and theft. I am now in contact with trading standards, the betting associations and the police. Set up an account and laid some bets on horse racing.All okay although the receipts were not very good in comparison with other online bookies - i.e. details were shabby regarding the time and date of the races and the actual title of the bet was missing - i.e. win only, each way, double, treble etc. so no record of what the actual bet was - just a list of several horse names. Later in the day I decided to bet on the Irish Lotto, did several lines of numbers and laid the bet - money taken. I then went to print a receipt - guess what? No receipt. No record of the bet anywhere in the account save for a couple of reference numbers in an obscure location in 'my account'. No record of the date or time the bet was made, the date or time of the draw, the stake, the numbers bet on or the odds. Nothing. So I contacted them via chat - initially not very helpful but then I was promised a manager would be involved and I would receive an email with the requisite details on. This did not happen. The day after I went to log on to chase up my complaint and remove my outstanding funds so I could shut the account down only to find it had been wiped. My log in information no longer worked and requesting  a new password by email resulted in nothing - no email, nothing in junk - no response at all. This is a big company but appears to be engaged in unlawful and criminal practice.",1
2016-03-13,"PaddyPower burst on to the scene a few years back with some risky humor and controversial TV ads.My experience with them however has shown me they are still small time, punching above their weight with marketing gimmicks.  I once tried to place a £200 bet on a boxing match (odds 2/1) only to be told max bet was £150.I then started to use PP only for their advertised promotion of bet £20, get £10 free in-play.At first this offer was riddled with ""technical difficulties"" sometimes not being credited until half-time.I perservered though and it became more reliable... but after 2 wins in a row on this promotion, the ""trading department"" made a ""business decision"" to exclude me from all PaddyPower promotions, free bets and money back specials. PaddyPower is not a serious bookie and clearly don't have alot of capital, they are terrified of paying out.  Good if you want to bet £1 on a football accumulator at the weekend and get it back as a free bet if some refund special is triggered. Use a real bookmaker, 365 or the Betfair Exchange.",1
2016-03-09,Spent an hour trying to find out why pp wouldn't be honouring the free bets that I was expecting as Sergio aguero scored twice at weekend and was told it was because they were no longer giving me any MBS(rec an email 2 weeks prev saying I no longer qualified for MBS but was not informed that it applied to bets already placed). I am absolutely disgusted by this and would urge others who have been affected by this to write a review and shame them.,1

2016-02-18,"Got banned from all offers after 3 months and wasn't using them all either. Paddy Power would believe that they are one of the big fish when the reality is they are not. They have restricted and closed hundreds of accounts this year so far as they don't like clever punters. All of this coincides with their interest in betfair not surprisingly. A 2 bit bookmaker having a share in a betting exchange is not healthy for the whole sporting industry in my opinion. They'd rather have us all being thick. They are insulting. The only decent offer they've run since December is their footy acca insurance one which everybody else does anyway. Spoke to live chat and it became clear that someone else had opened an account in my name, address etc fraudulently, so their security checks are sh**e as well. I closed my account as the competition beats them hands down anyway. My advice to anybody reading this is to not open an account with them, or if you have an account, close it.

Birth Certificate and marriage certificate provided with address details but apparently it still wasn't enough for them. Shut my account and took £656 with them saying that I was fake (fake with all details they asked for apart from photo ID, hmmm). Emails to IBAS and GC did nothing either.

Paddys say they have been aware of the problem since Friday but they did not send an email out - happy for people to continue to bet assuming incorrectly they would receive the free bet. They have apologised but refuse to correct. I feel very angry and expect my £20 to be refunded as it was only placed due to the offer being made to me.

2015-12-30,"Over £500 on Paddy Power Games in one night, not a single win. I realise gambling is a bit of a mugs game and is about luck mostly but this is a beyond a joke, I have done very well on most other on-line gambling sites, £700 on my first £20 deposit in Ladbrokes for example. I was playing Rainbow Riches, which has a RPT of 95%, for anyone who is new to this, this effectively means that you should expect to win at least £95 for every £100 staked, more often than not though you will get onto the bonus games and can walk away with a big payout, happened to me on Sky Vegas, BGO, Leo Vegas and Ladbrokes. But after spending £500 I didn't make a single win of greater than £20, how is it that this game has a 95% RPT then Paddy? In fact, this site uses the Winbig Shindig version of RR, which actually comes with a slightly higher RPT of around 96% I believe. The only time I even got onto a bonus game was when I was using up my last pennies, a 10 pence stake got me 3 gold pots, times 80 which won me £8.00. WOW THANKS! A whole £8.00! After staking as high as £10 most times where was my times 80 then?! Scamming, thieving, liars. Do not join!",1

I dont know why they havent resolved that, but its been ongoing for as long as I can remember using the site, and I guess they've just accepted that it will cost them less in lost bets than it would cost to improve the servers. Fun site though.

2015-10-21,"Hi Guys. . Just reading through some of the reviews i am shocked to see that anybody has had any issues with PaddyPower at all! I have only just recently signed up to the site and do not get the chance to use the site much because i am very ill but whenever i do use the site i find it really easy to navigate and quick to use. The live chat helpers are supremely helpful and always go the extra mile to help me as i am not the greatest when using my computer haha. They have also been very generous with free bets. . Just the other day i had come out of hospital and deposited £10 for the first time then 5 minutes later after placing my bet there was £30 in free bets in my account, which made my day amazing! I have told all of my mates and family that like a punt to sign up to PaddyPower as i think that highly of the site. Before u think because of these bad reviews u wont give the site a chance, have a go yourself. you wont regret it.",5
2015-10-04,"I lost 16 straight hands using basic strategy. SIXTEEN!! what are the odds? I win when I play the minimum amount, but as soon as I use the winnings and increase the stakes, i get stuck with these 14-17 hands and the dealer suddenly, and very magically, hits these fantastic miracle cards hitting that much needed 6 för 21. Every f*ing time. And as every addict, I don't stop playing, I continue. Been up every time I played the last ten times at least and lost it all because I increased the sum I wagered. Now, why would I increase the sum if I lose it? Beacuse it shouldn't matter!! I should get the same cards I did when I played the lowest amount available!!! But it doesn't happen one single time. As soon as the stakes go up, from nowhere, your cards get so much worse. Is there a way to investigate this f*ing rigg? They should be shot in the knees or something.",1
2015-09-17,"You can study a lot of very lengthy data around the randomness of some of the software deployed on Paddy Power's Casino Site.Basically it can be summarised like this: Don't use the online blackjack The slots are fine The customer service is actually not bad at all I think they should ditch certain suppliers of software and come clean, they would do themselves a favour. Check on CasinoMeister for more details F",2

Phoned for help wanting my money or to close account. They closed account but could not help with money. It feels like they do not want you to withdraw easily. Previously they sent a cheque but now can't do that. Did not want to accept verbal complaint very frustrating, feels like a one way street please avoid.",1
2015-08-22,"Poor internet security resulted in over 600,000 customers losing data. In addition they require photos of your cards plus driving licence details and utility bills.

Read other reviews for more info on this.",1
2015-08-20,"After reviewing Paddy Power some months ago, I have an update.  Since having one of my first two bets win with them £200 EW 16/1 I have tried on many occasions to get bets on with this ""Mickey Mouse"" firm and on each occasion they have cut my bets to a maximum of £5 or £10   They want to control how much you can bet with them and obviously you're not welcome with Paddy Power if you have a winner. I closed my account today.",1
2015-08-20,Saw an ad on Twitter offering enhanced odds for bets up to a tenner on a televised football match. Signed up and placed my tenner but only got the normal odds on winning. Complained and was told it takes up to 24 hours for the extra to be credited. Complained again after 24 hours and told it takes up to 48 hours for the extra to be credited. Complained again and was told I couldn't get the extra because I hadn't signed up through an affiliate link!! I mean really?? I threatened to close my account expecting that that may provoke some sort of reasonable response but no... they closed my account themselves. This is customer service at its very very worst. Anyone who says this bookmaker is great... all I can say is wait until you have a need to deal with customer service and you will have a change of mind. There are plenty of bookies out there... choose another one.,1
2015-08-17,"I recently joined as a new customer after reading their offer quote ""Open a new account, place your FIRST bet of £10 and we will give you 3 free bets of £10"" Having placed a bet for £10 in on two games, I never got my £30 free bet, I made a complaint and the reply I got after the 2 emails was; ""You need to place one single bet which can be an accumulator as that is one single bet , not three individual bets"" I then called their customer service to ask why the add says one thing and the email says different..... That was just a waste of time, the customer service was just not interested I will be closing this account and go to bet fair DO NOT TRUST PP",1
2015-08-12,"If they'd asked to verify my ID BEFORE I'd deposited money, I wouldn't even have an account.The GUI on their app is slow, cumbersome, unappealing and structured poorly.Cash out never works either.Pathetic for a bookmaker.",1

2015-05-29,"This online gambling provider need to be investigated and banned by the watchdog. They are not sincere and are rougues. The amount of complaints on here alone should give the watchdog a source of concern. PP lets you take you open an account, deposit money, win some money and once you win something, they highjack your account, set status to suspended and ask you to upload documents they never bother to check, they then close your account stealing all your money.......These crooks are con wo/men who are so in need of serious fraud investigation. I am not surprised at reading all the comments on this forum as I have experienced it first time. I wish all would be players/gamblers would come on here to read reviews first before ever signing up to this con site called Paddy Power. Paddpy Power is not real, they are con, fraud and cheat.....Don't sign up to use their service and i am starting a very serious campaign on social media to get this useless con company get its act together. Their security team nonsense does not exist, they just give that lame excuse to put you off. This company should be refferred to the independent watchdog for fraud and for cheating people. Their license should be revoked by the Gambling commission unless the commission have something they are being given back by these con company called Paddy Power",1
2015-05-14,Was given a fake £1 coin in shop when I asked to have it exchanged I was told very rudely no and it was my word against his as to whether he gave it to me or not. I called customer services and was basically told the same thing. I threatened to never use their shops again and close my account but still told the same so I did close my account and I will never use them again. If they are willing to lose a good customer over £1 it shows how much the paddy wa*k*** value our custom.As far as I'm concerned they are a bunch of THIEVING PYKIES.,1
2015-05-01,"I joined Paddy power and over the course of a couple of days I made a number of deposits all fully verified with my bank card online.They suddenly they cut me off literally IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME and restricted access to my account until I've verified myself by sending them a copy of my driving licence, utility bill and copy of my debit card. I take care of this immediately and Im then informed that I could have to wait up to 48 hours before I can continue my play. Thank you Paddy Power for treating me like a criminal, for taking 3 deposits, for waiting until I was losing and then ""blocking me"" in the middle of a game for UP TO 48 HOURS rather than asking me to provide all of this information before my first, second or 3rd deposit. Better to let people deposit first and verify them when it suits you. Shows how important this verification really is to you, eh ?At least if you're going to destroy someones night don't then make them then wait up to 48 hours after you boast 24/7 support.Horrible company, avoid at all costs.",1

2015-04-12,"Paddy Power are more than happy to take a payment from your debit card to place a bet, but when you try to withdraw it's a different story.  You have to verify your identity in order to withdraw any winnings.  I can understand this rule but they should have all new customers do this before they can place any bets.  It's designed to cheat and con customers and the system is deliberately difficult.  I won almost £100 on the Grand National and doubt I'll see any of it.  It's easier going into a bookmakers.",1

They offered a promotion in January on the Paddy Power Bingo side - spend £50 throughout the month and be invited to exclusive free bingo rooms - one from Monday to Friday 6-7pm and then your Gold Star free room which was advertised as being held monthly. Both of the free rooms advertised did not open - they said ""technical problems"" - yeh right - they wont even reply to emails and the CM's are about as useful as a chocolate ashtray.

There cash out is none existing I had around 8 bets on and only 2 were showing up which were both losing and the rest were up or 1 team of. Anyway after winning a bet I gave there live casino (roulette) a try, and considering I have signed up for nearly every betting site there live casino is by far the worst, it is not possible to win. I was doing spins were I was covering 23 numbers out of 37 and I must of been playing a good few hours and not one time did I win, I might of hit numbers to win some of my money back but thats about it, I was betting on my phone and after getting sick of losing I decided to stop and just left it in the screen and noticed my balance went down by itself. I went on live chat and there customer service is dreadful its like they only employ keyboard warriors. After repeating myself 3 times to him he says they might of activated autobet for me even though I didnt want it on. I doubt anyone will actually read this as my biography would probably be shorter but if anyone does, my advice is dont sign up and if you do just take advantage of there promotions and stop after they have stopped",1

2014-05-24,"I used to love paddy power. Then one night I had a ukash voucher. I'm disabled at present and awaiting surgery, so stuck in sometimes computer is my saviour when feeling a little down.Anyhow put my ukash in and it said it had been used. I knew it hadn't so I got in touch with customer service. Well basically this not very nice customer service agent basically wouldn't listen and told me that I had used it before and it would'n't work with him!  I was so upset. He told me to get in touch with ukash. This was on Sat night. I tried for two days straight, finally getting a reply and an answer to a phone call after 48 hours. When I went mad at them, they said no you only need this number there you go. Other casinos I've played have put money in my account for me in similar situations. SO I get in touch with Paddy Power get it sorted and wrote to them telling them how angry I am that it was their software etc. that had caused the problem. I got an email off someone from casino saying oh it happens all the time!! SO if they knew that why did the customer service agent accuse me of theft basically. SO anyhow since then whenever I have had a bonus on my account they wont work. SO I have written in and I have had emails telling me there is NO bonus on my account and when I have sent in a screen shot etc. to say yes there is I have received an email saying we can't help you with your query unless you put your security details one of them asking to confirm my email even though it is the email I write to them on I got turned down because I supposedly had two accounts even though I was the one who told them ages ago about the other account that was set up by an ex out of spite. Then when I write in again I get ignored after providing them with the security data. Yesterday I wrote asking to speak to someone this man called Conor got back and seemed genuine. Last night they did it again, told me they would help then after me saying about the ignoring me or sending the email saying put my security details etc. then taking the pee out of me. How horrible are they?? All because I objected to being called a thief. I get no bonuses or help yet as an idiot I still played loads every week because they pay out within a few hours. That's why I kept going. This is the longest I have ever gone on any bingo or casino without having a win. I cannot believe how horrible they've been to me, taking the pee but quite cruel and they are bullies. I'm not proud of some of the emails I've sent in despair and temper but I would never pick on a disabled customer just because they object to being accused of something they didn't do.",1

2014-05-22,In fairness to Paddy Power there isn't a market that you cant bet on. No matter what the  sporting event or occasion Paddy Power seems to offer punters a chance to win some money. And its not only the fact that you can bet  on almost anything its also the ease with which you can do so. If you don't fancy putting a bet on online with a laptop or on the go with their mobile app you can always just pop into one of their many shops across the country. Definitely the best bookmaker in the business. And to top it off they seem to have a sense of humor. Statue of David Moyes - Pure Genius,5

2014-05-22,"I've been using Paddy Power's website for 7/8 years now, pretty much since I reached the age when I could bet. I've used various other sites, but none have the same clarity or ease of use. You can see the odds clearly defined and there is no mumbo-jumbo on the site. The most simple user interface of anything I've used. Their special offfers are always easy to see and easy to understand. The account section for setting up a new card or deposit/withdrawls is clear and to the point. No other betting website makes things so clear Barry",5

Once i  tried to Cash out there was suddenly a security issue Now they have Blocked My Account and Can not Log in . Go on the Live chat and its like speaking to a Robot . They have No customer care what so ever. My Card is registered to the address i gave so there Can not be a security issue at all . Also why is there no security issue when they took a bet off me 10 minutes before . They are a Rip off company with no customer care or consideration . I am not a big betting person ion the slightest i just do it for fun . When i asked the customer service on the Chat to cancel the Account  they cant until they receive ID Which has been sent .

2014-04-05,I joined Paddy last November . Living in Greece I had a limited choice of companies for on line betting hence my lack of comparison with similar sites. However one thing I can  declare is the fact that during the period I am using Paddy I was left with no queries unanswered and an increasing  feeling of trust . I do have the feeling that ours will be a lasting relationship.,5
2014-04-05,I believe that Paddy Power are the best Bookmakers by far and deserve a 10 star ratingYour site is always fully informative and kept up to date with fantastic offersOn the odd occasion that I need to contact support my query is always dealt with both promptly and politely which I find very refreshing compared with other sites that take an age to answer and get sortedThe PP messenger that you have recently added is a fantastic aid to swift and concise betting which no other Bookmakers are offering to dateYou recent 2nd place refunds are both refreshing and good fun to do so please consider doing a full daily meeting offering this as I know it would be well received by your customersKeep up the good Work Paddy and well done Best WishesMiles,5

It's functional and eyecatching... and when I need to put a bet on quickly it does the job.  THE BAD The app is a massive improvement on what it was, but it doesn't tell you what winnings you'll get back when you look at your betting history for active bets. I believe the roulette as well as other games to be ""untrustworthy"" to say the least. So I stay away from them, but this is the same with every other website. I sent an e-mail with a few suggestions on how to improve their app... no reply. I sent another one... no reply.

2014-01-10,Love the offers an free bets that you do. I would say the mobile app for android devices need improving;- quite often the app will not open because it cannot get response from internet- sometimes it becomes unresponsive when selecting bets. find myself repeatedly pressing the same selection until it registers- and for sake of hindsight when looking at betting history I do wish it would show how much I WOULD have won if it wasn't for one team f%#@in up on me,4
2014-01-06,Paddy Power the most generous  site and fantastic  value ....But the bit part payout on multiple bets like lucky 15s ect is an awful idea and hard to keep track of what your being paid ...for this reason they lose 2 stars,3

2013-12-18,Very handy if you cannot get to one of the shops. It could benefit from an early cash out option and a few enhanced specials for existing customers.,4
2013-12-14,"The Paddy Power website has significantly improved in recent times. The website is now more user friendly and is now 'up there' with the likes of William Hill and Betfred etc. However, the question arises as to whether being 'up there' is sufficient for Ireland's and one of the world's leading bookmakers. I would argue that Paddy Power should be striving to have the best service that there is, and that your competitor's websites should be nowhere near the standards of yours. More improvement is needed, but Paddy Power have been heading in the right direction in recent times.Another point that I'd like to make relates to offers that your competitors currently have - Betfred, for example. They significantly enhance the odds on Goals Gallore coupons which is something you might like to consider. Also, their Double Delight/Hat trick Heaven is something that attracts customers to their website. Maybe an alternative to that might be something worth considering.",4
2013-12-12,Great website get promotions nothing to complain about,5
2013-12-04,"At times, Paddy Power offer you no other choice when it comes to betting with their unique offers and excellent customer service. Without a doubt the leading bookmaker within the marketing sphere, their daily promotions and specials offer the punter a good experience whilst betting.

Paddy Power truly leads the way in creativity and ambition, always looking for something new and different.",5

Password, name, security question answer, DOB. I have decided to close my account with them because of this.

2013-10-28,Placed a £10 bet with Paddy Power @ odds of 5/2 horse won @ 0/30jf Paddy paid out enhanced odds 5/2 but said their layers only gave it a 9/4 starting price.Ludicrous when Sporting Life; Racing Post all the daily newspapers and all the major bookmakers show the result as 0/30jf. Yes they've only short changed me to the tune of £8.00 but if you wager large amounts please be wary and use a bookmaker who is going to use the Industry sp and not concoct their own.,2
2013-10-23,"This company is a complete joke!! The first time I won £2000 I withdrew it and after 3 days looked in my bank account..  it wasn't there! so looked in my paddy power account and guess what it was there for me to gamble the lot and lose most of it. what a good ploy paddy power well done. saying i needed to verify my account, i verified my account and withdrew £600 and stoped betting with paddy power ...after 3 years of not betting on your site I placed a football bet today and won £260 and yet again paddy power are making it difficult to withdraw saying I haven't verified my account neither have a made a withdrawal. all because I deposited via ukash . I told them I got my debit card and passport which have my name the name I added to my paddy power account and still there refusing to payout because of security measures. OMG how can my passport not be good enough? This is the worst betting site stay well clear Ladbrokes and betfair never give you trouble in withdrawing your winnings. paddy power your a disgrace!! my point is every other bookmaker except your passport and debit card and allow you to withdraw your winnings in cash or back to a debit card even if you deposited via ukash , the reason why people get asked for id when you use ukash is to make sure your not money laundering so when I registered my name on paddy power web site and showed them my passport and debit card which has same name as registration why don't they let me withdraw. PADDY POWER YOU ARE A DISGRACE!!",1
2013-10-14,"My rather over lengthy review below is NOTHING  to what's just happened. It's OCTOBER 2016. I was deleting old emails and saw the horrible ones that upset me so much. I got in touch and saw they had a new CEO. I wrote to the CEO and the staff got in touch I got a bingo bonus and casino bonus. Made up and apology off Keneddy and MICHAEL (who I suspect was one of the original asses who did the horrible emails) I played for ages Could have withdrawn 100 but went for a meagre 30. They owe me so much. Anyway no money in SKRILL. So thought oh here we go. Then I tweeted, emailed TRIED TO GET ONLIVE CHAT NOPE. Many times. Was talking to mates on line and they told me to go for it. THE VERY THING THAT UPSET ME WHICH WAS BEING IGNORED THEY DID TO ME AGAIN. I GOT AN EMAIL TONIGHT THEY'VE BANNED ME FROM THE SITE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT USING MY ILLNESSES AS AN EXCUSE. I'M A WRITER AND ARTIST I GAMBLE FOR LEISURE NOW AND AGAIN. I DO CHARITY WORK. JUST FINISHED A BANNER FOR CANCER AWARENESS. OH WHAT DID I EXPECT. PLEASE DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY THEY ARE CROOKS COWARDS AND BULLIES AND RATHER THAN DEAL WITH A DIFFICULT CUSTOMER THEY BAN YOU USING THE RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING BANNER. GOD THAT ISN'T ABOUT CARING ABOUT PEOPLE IT'S A WAY TO GET RID OF YOU FROM A SITE YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT. THE MEMBER OF STAFF WHO DID THIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS I'M SURE OF IT. I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING ON ABOUT IT UNTIL SOMEONE TAKES NOTICE. WOW TRYING TO KEEP SOMEONE QUIET BY MAKING OUT THEY'RE TOO ILL. I thought paddy power was the best of the virtue fusion sites. Nope Gala, William Hill, bet 365, Betfair and too many to mention are. Seriously Paddy Powers online customer service for the bingo are a joke. They have treated me appallingly, and no one will take responsibility. But then I thought. MY GOD the way they tried to get people to bet whether or not Oscar Pistorius had killed his wife! How bad taste can you be. For the small mini minority who thought it was funny, well Paddy Power you are obviously so powerful now you don't have to be nice or accountable to anyone. That's how you come across. When I told you i was ill, and what did you do when I was upset. Played a really cruel joke on me. I was devasted that the staff can get away with it. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT CARE THEIR ATTITUDE IS AMAZINGLY BAD. I even had my one and only tiny win not put in my account until the next day when they usually do it in hours that is why I kept playing. Trying to keep my head down and the customer service idiot sorry agent whom I fell out with after he played a nasty trick on me, was on duty when I won so money being 24 hours late is that a coincidence? No I don't think it was. I've tried to contact a manager no deal, I've tried everything, however there is a way to contact their big boss, Patrick Kennedy is one of them and you can contact him through linked in but you have to pay a membership fee. One day I will do it, but he probably doesn't care anyway. their attitude of OMNIPOTENCE and thinking they're untouchable irritates me and you wouldn't think I have spent about 2000 plus with them since i started a long time ago. I have withdrawn approx £300 pounds. Every single other site I have played on I have withdrawn at least 50% of my stake or much more. It makes no sense to lose as frequently as I have on Paddy Power, then thinking they will play fair at some point, or more likely by the SHEER LAW OF AVERAGES I MUST WIN SOMETHING WORTH HAVING.Guess what??? NOT A BEAN. One thing life has taught me, whenever you get too big for your boots, you fall and it's a long way down on your own, and the same corporate fools and bosses you bend over backwards for will treat you with the same contempt they do everyone else, oh and you reap what you sow so the nasty support staff who were horrible to me well guess what when you're grieving and ill you wil get someone who treats you appalligly just so you understand how lousy it is.",1

2013-04-24,"OK I hear all the reviews on here saying thier great here is my experience. Joined about two weeks ago and bet around the £1000 mark on horses and live casino. Didnt win much but obviously thtas down to me and not anything to do with paddypower. My problem is the live casino. Bet £5.00 on the same numbers and lost on most occassions. Had bet for quite along time no problems each time losing and not having any problems at all with the site. Anyhow after losing quite abit did the same as id been doing put my money on same numbers and had a screen message your bet has not been accepted. This came up as the wheel was rolling and id put the bet on in time. Guess what my number came up. Tried again thinking maybe it was a glitch than same thing happens again and my other number comes up. They refunded me the bet immediatley and i was £380.00 down. Now this had never happened before on that day or any other and was losing quite abit only happened when my number came in TWICE.  Contacted the striaght away by phone and they assured me they would be in touch within 24hrs as they can look in the history and determine what went wrong. The guy on the phone said he could see i always picked the same numbers and could see that my bet had been refunded twice. Anyhow kept my trust in them thought it would be sorted next day, next day nothing so contacted them again and told would hear next day. Waited again and after the third day when they said they where still looking into it closed my account and told them to forget it. Beware great when your losing, strange goings on when you win.",1

The offer as wide a range of markets as anyone, have good support, accept  many payment types and payout promptly. One slight gripe is the difficulty in changing your preferred deposit method (need to have almost no money in your account and have no pending bets before they'll let you change) compared to some other bookies.",5
2012-12-04,Excellent site - will recommend to all,5
2012-12-03,Ya I thought it was very good and would recommend it to all others,5

2012-11-30,"These enhanced specials even run alongside 'Money Back Specials' which makes it that bit easier. Its still not  a certainty but Paddy does their best to help out, no doubt about that. Nearly all bets are covered, and if you want odds for a different market, all you have to do is follow 'AskPaddyPower' on Twitter and they get back to you in no time. If you dont have twitter, just get it, not only do you get extra specials but there's lots of banter and good laughs.I have never had a bad experience with customer service. I once had an issue with placing bets on my Firefox browser..Paddy had it sorted for me in 15 minutes. No bullshit!",5

My mate said he got his money back recently to when the horse he backed was bout to win but took a wrong turn on the track  and lost! They know how to keep the punters happy.  They have good casino games too.,5

2012-07-21,"the specials are great, the only thing i would say wrong about them is that i bet online cos cant get to the betting shop, but the specials in shop are different and sometimes better, like doubling the odds and other 1s, like when the did a price special on ruby you get next odds up in shop, but not online should give a few like them online aswell in the shop,",5

Just adding to this previous review, still not got my money back , William Hill HQ now asking me for ID, why the heck do they need my ID, this is so ridiculous, it's my money and I want it back !!!",1
2023-01-25,Great at first with offers then yet another fix of a casino. Use foxybingo its fair. I did an experiment on slingo and low and behold every time the spins have delay you can predict the outcome. Hence this site is fixed. Why cant you just be an honest casino and keep real money playing customers. Spent enough and never had a win. That i am not to bothered about it the fact the fix is so obvious it takes the fun out of playing. AVOID ..use foxy.,1
2023-01-25,"I did a bet which in the Barcelona v Rael Sociedad match, it included R/S to have had more cards shown than Barcelona. Finished R/S 1 red card and 1 yellow, Barcelona 2 yellow cards - normally a red card counts as 2 yellows but fair enough in WH rules it only counts as 1 (unfair but acceptable I suppose) however R/S were shown a yellow card first before it went to VAR and then they were shown a red card so in fact in the match they were shown 3 cards. William Hill would not accept this and complaint was just dismissed. Be warned as thousands will of done this special offer bet.",1

I’ve sent passport, driving licence, banks statements - they just keep asking for more! I’ve tried their online chat - who apparently can’t help me - and that I need to upload more ID until they will speak to me. I don’t know what other ID they can possibly need- which is what I’m trying to find out! They are now asking me to send the ID to a different place, which I’m wary of doing. It all just seems a bit off. They seem like a load of scammers- and make it very difficult to speak to anyone.

Anyway they closed my account after I gave them the response they deserve to their ridiculous request, so good riddance.",1
2023-01-25,"An honest review, the staff are knowledgeable, helpful, odds are offered on a wide variety of sport, either by bets over the counter or via ssbt machine. The mean side is no best odds guaranteed on horses, very few extra Place races, and no bonus for one winner in lucky 15,31 or 63, all a bit disappointing when most other companies give these bonuses. You can open a plus account which allows you to get boosted odds on sports via the ssbt machines. Now for the slots, well, I've never witnessed such corruption and theft really as when playing a Hills slot, the odd person may get a win but for most it's a sad game, you put money in and don't even get a game for your money, bonuses as rare as unicorn poo, I've played a lot of slots but these are the worst shop slots I've ever seen, not just for me but I've seen friends put in horrendous amounts of money and hardly get a win let alone a game for their money, so do yourselves a favour, if you like a slot, then play anywhere but hills!!!!!",1

Slots here are disgusting. They even emailed me after I played to say about safer gambling. Probably because I'd lost my money with only an RTP of 1%. You use to get good rewards and free bets on here too but now that's stopped. You only get 5 free 10p spins now that always are dead. They're just take take take now. I play more at paddy power. £5 free spins every week and I get free football bets sometimes up to £25.",1

The games allow me to withdraw funds but then rob it all back & more. Mayfair roulette is so fixed, the ball can land on your number & then jump out. This happens constantly.",1

2023-01-18,I have been a william hill customer for about 20 years and been betting online with them for about the last 10 years. Never had any problems untill last night. I was playing on a 20p to 40p slot machine which is my normal highest stake after a couple of minutes I look at my balance and it had gone down £40. I contacted them and after about an hour was told that I had also been playing on a seperate slot machine at the same time that was £3 a spin . Now 1 in 20 years I have never played with that high stake and 2 more importantly as anyone that plays slots knows you can not play 2 slots simultaneously you have to close one to open another one . Surly william hill must also know this . But they still keep saying I was playing both at the same time REALLY. IT CAN NOT BE DONE so much for being a loyal customerCORAL here I come,1

The cash wowpot is so badly named. I was actually wowed how bad it is. No decent wins at all, I've not even seen the cash pot give anything away at all. In fact it's a joke. This game is just cash riches (another scam) dressed up in very similar clothing. The fact you don't value your customers enough to at least offer something back at all in the way of decent wins is a flawed business model. Your making good customers look elsewhere for a gaming experience and are just taking money off ppl addicted to slots. Either way it's a form of corruption.

I thought my bet won and I had the option to cash out but I didnt due to this error.. I thought it was already second half and the 1st it was under 2.5... After a few minutes..

I have submitted one more document and if this gets rejected without good reason I’ll be getting the gambling commission/ombudsman involved, as it’s clear they are doing anything to no pay out.

2022-11-10,"Please please please do not trust this site. About 2 weeks ago William hill decided to go into my bank account Nd take out £30 without my permission Nd when I confronted them about it with proof of them taking this money, they straight up denied taking the money Nd refused to give it back where I had to get my bank involved in order to get my money back. Since then I have deposited Nd made several withdrawals without any issues what's so ever. Infact I was able to withdraw the day they decided they wasn't going to let me withdraw anymore. They suspended my account Nd kept hold of my money Nd refused to give me my withdrawal telling me they had to run through security checks with me Nd how it's required by law. Bullcrap. Never had any issues b4 until I got my stolen money back from them using a dispute with my bank. I have given them all the documents they need Nd they keep asking for more then coming back saying it's been all my documents have been denied Nd I need to send them again. I have been on live chat all day from 7am this morning Nd been passed about Nd kept waiting for hours only for them to come back with same results. These are not to be trusted",1

They say it's about Safer Gambling....rubbish!!!! Most of these promotions are free to enter and don't cost to enter re 'Free or 4' Which is supposed to be an absolutely free no risk deposit game to enter. I thought It was about football fans enjoying predicting the number of goals in 6 matches over a full season! It is meant to be a bit like a seasonal league where you can win either weekly, monthly, or for the full season. They have restricted me from using this promotion and they just say it's because of safer gambling!!! Absolute Utter rubbish!!!!!!!!!! It's because I've had some big wins of late and they don't want me to gain anything extra! Why offer these promotions in the first place? They only want your money! Why offer something your company can't provide? I will be leaving this money-making company and joining another betting website that actually looks after its loyal customers with loyalty bonuses and promotions.

I received an email to say: 'We wanted to let you know that after a recent review of your account, you’ll no longer be able to take advantage of our gaming offers or promotions.This restriction will apply to our gaming products, and stake restrictions may also apply in the future.'I was then unable to use the online chat support to ask anything, so the only other option was to ask them via Twitter. When I asked if and why my account was restricted I was given this response:'I'm afraid the information is not available on our end as this was made by our management decision but rest assured a thorough check has been done and the decision was not taken lightly.'So I asked if I was able to email someone as I was unable to access the live chat support and I then received 'We no longer have email support. We do have live chat support (included link)'Which I had already stated I couldn't use.Absolutely awful not being able to see if I was able to get my account unrestricted and how I could make sure I didn't do whatever I had supposedly done again.

2022-11-08,"Absolutely disgusted with these people used speak highly of them until recent even used to frequent their Shops but never again since they have tried to swindle my Partner out of £20 of her own money a mere drip in the ocean to a big name like William Hill. So William Hills argument is this to justify not returning my Partners money who by the way is considered one of their Vulnerable Customers due to living with Agoraphobia and bad Anxiety induced Panic Attacks which is why she chose to use their App instead of visiting one their Shops as leaving her House causes her great Stress and Discomfort, they say they can't return the money she has in her William Hill Account due to a new Government Legislation whereby all Customers must provide Photo ID to Verify who they are before any further Payouts can be issued but the problem is with Big Changes of this nature Customers should have been made fully aware of the coming Changes via Email to which my Partner received none the only time my Partner was made aware of any Change in Legislation was when she tried to withdraw her winnings and it was at that point she was informed of the Change and told ""Until you provide us with Photo ID you wont be able to Cash Out your Money, but feel free to make another Deposit without Photo ID and continue betting we just can't let you Cash Out until we see some Photo ID"" which perplexes me to say the least, now the issue is my Partner does not have Photo ID she hasn't left her house in 5yrs I run her errands for her and she has no desire to travel outside of her Home let alone anywhere Abroad so she has no use for a Passport. Again I'm absolutely shocked and disgusted with the treatment my Partner has received from the William Hill Team and if they continue to try and play hardball with my Partner and not cough up what is owed i will be taking charge of the situation myself and lawyers will get involved and it will end up costing them a lot more than £20.",1

2022-07-31,I regret having to give it a new one star should be able to give it in no stars well where do I start with this company the biggest joke of all so she win they changed the rules of this safer gambling has given them the rights now to cut you off whenever they feel that you're ever going to hear near to a good pay out or or they don't want to resolve an issue what is outstanding I am now going to be handing a lot of screenshots and video pictures of incidents at a deal with William Hill's I am custard in however treated a they launched me with a £100 per month maximum to pay basically and so I proved differently but in that time I'm something went wrong with the system so they had to reboot it in that time they've totally forgot to reorder my figure back to the £100 as it rebooted to whatever I wanted to spend so when I brought it up into a conversation saying what I thought there was £100 but you said per month they returned with no this £500 and they're reset it to 530 forgetting that I had the emails and correspondence to this part 2 to the second part of this after themselves in that I was penalised and I had spent £336 and I was just about to hit a nice could pay out on one of the games I was playing and then I got penalised and I was put under the safe gambling of no promotions nothing to do and I will get in nothing given a reason why I'm not even told how long I will be stuck on this this was over 8 weeks ago a thing to any customer what makes me laugh out of all this when I first thought this up when they penalised me I surround said to them how comes when we sign into your contract of paying £10 or £20 depending whatever deposit you had to pay at the time I think mine was 10 that gave you one year of 3 activities whatever they supplied per day in a time I have been missed LED off of the side and still not understanding the reason why I've heard than I was going to have a nice day out and if you want me to have it I I have asked them on number of times will they then credit me he missing spins this and drops casino promotions that I've lost out on I haven't that time when I got that up I asked would there be a except time limit of when I will be released off of this and I have still not been given any insulin the worst part of it all though and it was brought in effect I asked the customer agent to give me the the complaints department in the reason I asked for it as it was in a live chat because that is the only service they have as they don't have no more email don't have no phone calls it's just like that their rules are to prove if you have been not paid from a game you need proof as in photo evidence time date as action so my answer was I wanted to say I want to prove that the email address I was given was the right one reason this being is one I've had a customer service agent I asked 2432 manager he turned around and said no problem at all put me through to the manager and it wasn't and it wasn't until conversation got to the end and I will see what he says about this not being that this someone harder than him because he was going to be the highest person that I could deal with them going through to the complaints department as these people must be the most stupid people going because etsy black and white in text and I tried to delete things but problem is as I have to learn in a big mistake on a company called paddy power that I made sure that everything is recorded under video when I'm never playing any sites because without that you've got no way of trust in a company give you your money if you're happy to hand your money over to people like that without having evidence then you must be millionaires because they will rip you off as quick as I can two point of back to the reason I ask for the complaints department email is one I've only put one complaint in past their time and didn't get feedback it took for managers that I asked and ass and ass for the actual email address and everytime I ask and ask they disconnect and I have these are some screenshots colour and the worst part of it all I had to threaten them by saying that I will not put this on every Media child I can think of Instagram Twitter Facebook proven that they do not want to give you the chance of putting into their own complaints department that's the worst part I am still to this day not even heard or where is it going I know they've been fined heavily over this but they're using the safe gambling was meant to be there for us customers to protect the ones what are not laugh is he know you can go anywhere look up to another site and can go away just another site is having that money than you trying to stick with one side is it a bond I get your trust and they have broken their trust unbelievably so William Hill I really hope for the time I have finished getting all this evidence together as so much that they get find more than 16 million 18/ 13 this is a few that they've been fine this year welt.de of put on the wrong person this time,1

2022-10-23,"Always liked using William hill in shop and online. I don’t bet all the time but when I do there normally decent bets. Win some lose some. I’ve self excluded from my local shops to take away the thought of going in because am just passing so I drive 20 minutes or so on the days I fancy a bet.Never really had any issues until last Sunday, I placed 2 bets at the same time 1 was a single the other a double. The 1st horse won and I was paid out, I also had this horse in the double. So the other horse wins and then am hit with proof of income by a really snotty woman in the shop. I had a moan got nowhere was told I have to e-mail in to go threw security checks before I can be payed out. I e-mailed them was told I needed to provide proof of income. I sent in my tax returns and driving licence 1st thing Monday morning and 20 mins later got a reply saying they have received the documents so I was thinking this isn’t going to take too long.How wrong was I. Its now Friday my bet won 5 days ago William hill have had my documents for 4 days I’ve phoned the customer help number a couple of times the last 2 days to be told it takes as long as it takes there is no timeline to review the documents and pay out the bet ? They have over £5000 of my money and I literally can’t do a thing about it other than sit and wait. Am checking my e-mails 20 times a day. It’s so wrong that they can withhold your money. I do place big bets £50 / £100 sometimes a bit more, the shop in question I’ve been going in for 3 weeks they have had so many opportunity’s to ask for this proof of income but never have, not until I’ve had a decent win. I totally accept they have to do checks on customers especially ones that bet big but mine along with most others I know of it’s never when your betting big they ask for these documents and stop you spending until you provide them it’s always when people have a decent win and then they hold onto your money. Mine wasn’t like I won thousands off them that win I think put me pretty much even over the  3 weeks or so I’d been going in that shop. Horrible to get excited you’ve had a big win to then have the anxiety and stress of trying to get your money. It literally is my money they have, it should be sitting in my bank account now. I’ve give this 2 stars because I’ve always liked using this company there fixed odds betting terminals are much better for football than others.Hearing this is happening to more and more people. The gambling commision shouldn’t allow it them checks if required for someone betting higher amounts should be done before any further bets are placed. Once they have accepted the bet if it wins they should have to pay out it’s wrong. If I was in that shop betting high for 3 days when I walk in on day 4 why not pull me then before I place a bet. Give me it in writing informing me that before I place any further bets I need to provide proof of income. I couldn’t argue then. The way they do should not be allowed. Hopefully I get my payment soon. More days of stress until I do. The enjoyment of having a bet and a winner has been taken away for me now.",2

2022-10-21,This company is disgusting can someone advice me what to do. I suffer mental health depression and suicidal. I’m on anti depressant and other medication. Last Friday 21/10/22 i placed bet on their machine on tennis in the shop for £1000 and I won £100. I took my betting slip to shop to claim my £1100. The head office block my ticket so the shop told me to email them I sent 40 emails over past four days no response. I manage to speak to them telling them u suffer suicidal depression and will kill my self  if I don’t get my money back no response. I spent weekend in hospital because I tried to Kill myself. Police came to my house twice to check on my safety. Eveytime I call for update the stupid guys keep telling me sams response senior team is investigating. Can someone help me give me advice? Will they steal my money ? Is that what they do? I’ve never had problems any other book makers. I even told them I will film myself killing myself and send them so they will have to live with it they don’t even give a damn. Disgusting vile people working for them with no feelings and they don’t even give a damn if I was dead and they all sound like robots on the phone with no feelings.

2022-10-21,"I have not received my withdrawal No phone number or email for contact . waiting forever talking to the bloody robot .Been using william hill 50 years but as soon as I get my money or find out where the hell it is Im gone .Adding to this 6 hours later . I o[pened my aacount with William hill years ago . The last time Imade adeposit was 6 months ago and I was able to bet no problems. 3 days ago I withdrew some money that never reached my bank . today i was asked to verify my account by answering the security qustions which was no problem the asked to verify my account this was where the fun started . I was asked to write down my login on a bit of paper and take a picture of myself holding it. I was asked for a picture of myself holdsing up my passport and proof of my address . I sent them all this and a bank statement but tht was not good enough they wanted a pic of me holding the bank staement and needed to show the deposit made to them . 1 hour later I get a email telling me basicly they were going to close my account pending a review. I go back on the chat line and asked what the review is for? after 30mins he fianaly tells me the letter I sent with proof of my address was slighty croped . the leter clearly showed that it was from my bank showing my full address bank account details but was not good enough instead of writing to me and asking to take a full pic of my private details they thought it best to close my acount and keep my money. I got the chance to upload that one piece of paper again so now witing to see if i get verifyed . I have loads of betting accounts william hill and all they asked for was a picture of my passport and guess what I didnt need to be holding the bloody thing.cant wait until I get my money and see how quick I close my account .... 21.10.22Just a follow up 24.10.22So after sending a photo of my passport , drivers licence , answering all my security questions many times over , sending proof of utility or other with my address showing , sending my last 3 month bank statement , other bank statement showing deposits made to william hill , a photo of myself holding the statement another holding my passport and another holding my drivers license I have now recieved clearance and allowed to withdraw my £90.00 .This company now has a complete profile on me and all my details shared with many of the staff working at William Hill. I feel like I have been robbed of my Identity .please note you are fine for 20 years when making a deposit its when you make a withdrawal all hell breaks loose. One thing is for sure that safe gambling week with William Hill truly works for I will never make a wager with them again .Thanks very much Willim hill for making my life hell. And also thanks for telling me in a email me how much money I have left in my account and in the same email telling me my account is still under review, in other words you had not confirmed me to be who I say I am but tell me how much left in my account LOL Good day and thank heavens Im on my way out instead of on my way in.",1

2022-10-20,"I have been playing on William Hill (depositing money, losing, winning & playing the free games) for a couple of years. Today, I am unable to play any bonus games etc and when I contacted them, they replied: This decision was based on the type of activity identified on the account and/or that your activity was deemed to target our promotion bonuses in a way other than their intended purpose.They are unable to give me anymore explanation what this intention is but I am going to presume it is because I complained about it one of their games glitching the other day and constantly kicking me off every time I won.",1
2022-10-19,Wish I could give it 0. Used this for years and they offer free plays on games everyday  to entice customers in then randomly block you from using them without an explanation. The bonus drop has been banned from me for no reason. First excuse was this is a technical issue let me pass this to our IT team try again in 1 hour Then they said that it’s to safer gamblingThen they said that there’s no restrictions on my account so to use website instead of appThen after waiting 3 hours got a response to say they’ve reviewed my account and removed my permission for this. Spoke to a “superviser” who was the most dire and disrespectful person I’d spoke to I have only ever used the winnings from bonus drops to place bets alongside my own money like any betting site allows as does my partner and his is all fine? Asked for a manager or CEO contacts details been refused everytime. was told they couldn’t tell me why they’ve done it or anything FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! Do no put any money into them!  Disregarded everything I have said and sent template pre written responses which is so obviousWill still allow me to bet and do other promotions however? Scared to withdraw my money in case they steal from meSTICK TO SKY BET or BET 365 or BETFAIR !,1
2022-10-18,Absolute bandits give a bit then take take take fixed slots I know there not here to hand out money but come on give us a chance you place deposits to play there reward to customers is then bar your account from receiving any promotions or free plays and hide behind the safer gambling but at same time continues to take deposits to play complete bull sh** .Stay clear I only wish I had come across these reviews a few weeks ago believe me they aren't wrong and just saying it because they are sore losers.Do yourselves a favour and take note of them.Account now closed good riddance,1
2022-10-18,Stay away ! Very few wins and when you do win it’s peanuts. 50p spin and 3 scatters only won £2.30 . Spent £400 not won anything or even come close. Rip off,1

2022-10-15,"I had a 19 accumulator football bet on first half over 0.5 goals. All the bets came through except the Sunderland vs Wigan match, which was  shown as losing. I was offered a £7 cash out and low and behold, less than three seconds after cashing out, they showed Sunderland had scored. Coincidence, bad luck? I don't think so, as it has happened twice before.They hide the true scores and tempt you with cash out. Once you've cashed out, you will find out that your bet was actually a winning bet or had a high chance of winning.Like someone stated earlier, I will be returning to old fashioned bet in store.

2022-09-28,William hill have lost their way from being a trusted high street brand to being a casino scammer.why I hear you ask.let me break down my opinion and feel free to comment. Firstly William hill decided to take down all customer phone numbers only live chat or email is available so they dont have to reply face to face as to why you feel scammed.but if you look a little deeper you'll notice that they took phone numbers down and then all off a sudden things go purposely downhill for punters.my list is this 1 games casino and sports promotions get  poor.2 chat is always down and when you can chat the cs hasn't got a clue about gamling. Under trained unprofessional staff.3 site is laggy and slow.4they seem keen to shut accounts without respecting the customers concerns. 5 the tend to favour slots that pay little rather than big win paying slots.ive noticed they cherry pick slots that will take more than they give.meaning when was the last time you hit a quick bonus and that bonus was worth a cashout? 6 they hold back withdrawal only from winning customers wanting to withdraw. Their not bothered while your losing but when you hit a win they want to do a source off funds and blame money laundering regulations using this scam is typical off a rogue online gambling site. 7 cashout is greyed out most the time on accumulated bets.greyed out more than most example. I put the same bet on William hill as I did on ladbrokes. 4 x football acumilater £10 I was offered from ladbrokes 53 pounds cashout when 3 teams had won yet the 4th was still at a draw.yet at William hill the bet was greyed out and unable to cashout they let it stay greyed out untill the clock run out and the bet declared a loser.this happens all the time.8the site goes down more offen than other sites.9 poker rooms are full off bots.10 I've put bets on roulette live games and when the spin occurs it rejects the bet funny because the ball seems to be just about to land close to your winnings numbers? ...thats just an insi9into a few issues I've had at william hill and  have about 20 more but they are just more moaning about this same scam site.my opinion is things went downhill when ladbrokes merged with corral William hill lost a big market share so to keep profits high and compete they decided to scam customers and reduce staff to make up the shortfall...this happens in a lot off businesses that are failing in their targets they cant create growth so they find the cash they need to report profits my taking bigger margins directly from your wallet.even the odds on hourse racing bets are lower than typical market odds.try for yourself do an acumilater William hill and another preferred site off your choice.make the bets identical and see the odds at William hill will be lower and the cashout will be unavailable more often.,1
2022-09-27,"Allowed my underage child to open an account and found out he lost all his savings, I can't believe a company of this size doesn't have a phone line to speak with a manager, I tried the live chat if you can call it that and what a bunch of  idiot,s just tried to fob me off first by saying my son needs to live chat them himself for data protection even though he was sat next to me and gave me all his login details, so then had to pretend i was my son, and they shouldn't be asking underage children to contact a gambling site, then they spouted clause 4.3 about not refunding losses and its the account holders responsibility for all losses, not if they are underage its William Hill responsibility to make sure children can't open accounts, I'm taking this further with the gambling commission William Hill will not get away with it, shocking company to deal with",1

2022-09-16,I began betting with the W.H shop in Alvaston Derby in March 2022. I can honestly state that this is a joke of a betting shop the staff there constantly rob you on the prices they give you and their football prices are the lowest on the UK markets. I have moved to a far better online company who are not jealous of every win you have. The days of these high street con artists is very nearly over. If it was not for the four machines in each shop they would already be bankrupt. Do not trust any W.H employee they are trained to mislead honest gamblers avoid all W.H High street shops and their online scammers like the plague! P A Enright of Derby,1

2022-09-14,I felt it was alright until I realised that one of my friends got jackpot 2 twice yet had been on Williamhill only few months where as those who have done it for year some of us have never seen a jackpot or anything hardly from it. I recently changed to another well known gambling site has proven the odds are better fair enough house always wins but odds are better than williamhill,1
2022-09-11,"Live chat at William hill is like talking to a brick wall, completely useless and untrained staff. I had two or three queries, they basically half answer one query then disconnect you rather than giving a full explanation. They wouldn't give me the email address for complaints because apparently that can only be released by a supervisor - and there wasn't one available. When I again went on live chat to complain they said they a manager would email me with a response - the manager did email me but it only covered about 20% of my initial query. Going round and round in circles. Their staff are clearly thick and don't care. Which is a shame for a company of William hills size. I've been betting with them for 20 years but I'm sticking with Betfair and bet365 now as they are the only ones that resolve your issues appropriately.",1

I then emailed William Hill outlining the problems i keep getting “unexpected error 204” whatever that is? WH then emailed me back stating email support has been stopped and that I need to use online chat. Well why would they advertise a customer services email on the app when email support has been withdrawn. Their customer service absolutely sucks,1

Since about April 2022 I'm down £300-£400 every month and I believe this is since their take-over. I've not won a single panny and up until April this was my favourite slot site. Don't waste your time and money, William had become greedy and thieving website. Idk about casino or sport bets but as far as slots it's horendess and all I can call William Hill now is a thief. Pure daylight robber. Never again.",1

2022-09-04,"Signed up and happily deposited money before my account was locked. I thought that was fair enough as I’d not yet completed any verification checks but it was weird that they were happy to accept a deposit and then locked the account immediately after. Regardless, everything was sent as requested and then they respond saying that my online bank statement is not enough proof of an address as they don’t accept Monzo for some bizarre reason. Not only this, but they also rejected a very clear and in focus ‘selfie’ of me and my passport which they requested. It’s in date and completely valid etc so I have no idea as to why this would be rejected. They refuse to send the deposit back to the card it came from. Awful experience and they clearly do this regularly looking at the other reviews. Awful awful awful",1
2022-09-04,"Never again, big scam",1
2022-09-03,"I’ve just had the most horrible experience this morning with William Hill online customer  services, there is absolutely no customer service whatsoever. I’m amazed to see that they have three stars on trust pilot out of five ? I’ve just looked through several pages of the reviews and they’ve only achieved one star? I have spent about an hour on this asking on the online chat to speak to somebody and have been constantly reverted back to the same questions when . You  cannot actually speak to anybody and this wastes a lot of time and makes you very frustrated and angry. I’m surprised that they don’t realise that they are will lose lots of customers?  I am not able to get into my online account for some reason,  I was logged out of it and I cannot remember my login details. I looked on the Internet for all possible numbers to call William Hill, one  of the numbers registered was invalid another number was invalid they clearly don’t want to speak to their customers. This company have no respect for their customers whatsoever and clearly do not value them.I resorted to the online chat that was the only possibility of contacting somebody and wasted about 45 minutes to an hour getting absolutely nowhere,  the online chat service did not recognise my email which I have used for the last 10 years and constantly reverted back to the same answer that they couldn’t do anything as it was an invalid email address. Even at the point I said I was going to have a heart attack over this they reverted back to the same answer. This is heart attack making and it is the most appalling customer service that I have ever encountered.A great deal of companies now use online chat but you can speak to a member of staff if the issue is not resolved. This is clearly not possible at William Hill.  I shall be calling their head office on Monday morning and I shall be making Making a big complaint To the regulating body I have screenshot most of the conversations on live chat so I have evidence of the conversation. once I get into the account I shall be closing it is because it’s the most appalling customer service as I said that I’ve ever encountered. Essentially they are withholding my money in their account which they are denying at me access to.",1

2021-12-01,Document verification is unreasonably difficult to get through. The team just keep rejecting the documents so that you can't log in and remove your money from your account.,1

2022-08-15,I’ve been with William hill for 10 plus years and I’ve tried nearly every other gambling site but always come back to WH. Fast payouts and very generous. Thanks so much 🙏,4
2022-09-01,"I tried to register on this website but couldn't do so due to some bizarre verification checks they wanted to carry out. I’d have thought that a driving licence, utility bill, and credit card statement would be sufficient proof of identify, and other bookmakers would seem to agree. But William Hill insist that all of those things are supplied to them in the form of a selfie of you holding the document. Very weird!Providing this with a driving licence is do-able because everyone has a physical card, but who these days is receiving paper copies of bank statements vs receiving them electronically? William Hill seem to be living way in the past on this one; maybe one day they’ll get up to speed and bring in an actual verification system rather than a system of people sending selfies while holding pieces of paper. It’s impossible to discuss the matter in a reasonable way with them via email or live chat. They are very arrogant, basically their view is “you don’t have bank statements or a printer to print them out, then that’s just tough”. Fortunately they hit me with this before I was able to deposit. Sadly there seems to be cases where they’re withholding funds until their verification checks are met, which they keep moving the goalposts on (e.g. requesting un-redacted bank statements with sensitive financial data). Terrible behaviour. Do not sign up with this company, your account could be locked at any time and then you’ll be having to do things you’re not comfortable with in order to stand a chance of getting your money back.",1

2022-09-01,I have been using William Hill for over a year and have not had too many issues. The app is not the best and do find some of the icons do not work.The promotions are pretty good except for Scratch of the Day. I have used this promotion every day for three months but I never get a win.  I have asked William Hill to look into this but was told “the promotion is fair and there is a very good chance of winning”.  I would not describe not winning after 100 attempts as “a good chance”. They also stated I was having a “run of bad luck”… run.. more like a marathon!I was just trying to point out a potential system issue but they have intention to investigate.,2

2022-08-25,I have had the same issue as others here. They are ok to take money from my account without the correct ID in place but would not pay out. I don't have the documents that request and have tried in vain to get a straight answer to how to rectify.  Find staff in live chat dismissive and rude and no help at all.  I have now found the email for complaints (second_opinion @ willhill.com) and am awaiting a response.

We all write reviews saying boycott it “I’m sending prove to get you shut down !!”  blah blah blah but we need to sort our own addiction out first.

I’ve spoken to live chat several times who have also told me to go into store but the store claim they have nothing to do with online. I’m going round and round in circles. Any time I present them with a screenshot of proof of my last conversation, pay out page or proof of verification they change the route they send me down. Some of the things I’ve been told:- Create a new account - Resubmit ID- Go into store to sort it- Go into store to claim my money - The pay is pending Full on trying to scam customers out of money!!And to top it off, now all of a sudden I can’t get through to live chat 🤣",1
2022-08-17,My account was suddenly banned from making deposit and withdrawal. They asked me to verify my account which I've done before.

2022-08-11,Have had no problems with William Hills.I find most of the promotions are very good and better than other sites I use.The only weak point is the bonus drop which you very rarely win on.Overall probably the best site I use at the moment.,4
2022-08-11,I don’t mind William hill. But if 888 has taken over I know now what the problem is. The promos on slots are really good but lately stake £10 get 10 free spins ok but when you do get your free spins theirs nothing at all won . Same with the £10 stake n get 5 free spins. Just lately these promos have given not one penny. It makes it then so you can’t play any of the other slots as you’ve spent all on the promotions. I still like the site but I’ll give it another week to see if the promos get any better if not I will close it. If I’ve been on chat I have no trouble they are very nice. It’s going to be a shame if this is happening all the time. I’d be sorry to close my account but  if this is regular then yes I will close it down.,4

He agreed to call me when the people who fix the machines looks into it as only they can determine what was won. I think it's a very iffy situation. I wanted to complain to William hill but, unsurprisingly none of the numbers on the website work. Even the head office one rings once and then cuts out.

2022-08-06,"I've been a depositing customer at William Hill online for 15 / 20 years. Today I keyed in an erroneous number by mistake, a typo and instead of placing the intended 80p I actually put 18.80. I scrambled to get to an agent to cancel but the bet was on virtual racing and they run every 2 minutes.  I asked the agent just look at my betting pattern to see that I don't ever bet that amount, nowhere near and it is an honest typo mistake. Response ""Race is ran, bet is settled"" and basically too bad! I'm going to IBAS with this because there is literally no recourse to cancel an erroneous bet and that's so ridiculous it's got to be deliberate. Absolutely fuming!Update. I asked them for the last three conversations I had with an agent. They sent me them, with the second missing. This was the comment in which as I was typing a response, agent disconnected and told me they can't refund a bet I didn't mean to make and I asked why, unlike other live or virtual games, the dont have a cancel bet option for the player who may add an extra 0 on the end. And now I go to log in and it states ""theres a problem with your acct. Please check emails we've sent you."" I check, nothing. Is it part of your operating licence to delete customers relevant info from their account as you please to hide the face you know the agent deliberately took something I said, spun it, took it out of context deliberately, and now I have a gambling problem for asking for a misplaced bet to be refunded because they don't have that optionDay later, get out through to supervisor ""JV"" who won't give me his/her name for IBAS? Anyhow, heres the transcript and what to expect if you decide to play there....""Your account is already being reviewed and raised regarding the said dispute. There is no update for now. We'll advise you thru email once there is one.

Do you endorse that decision as a supervisorFinal response plz for IBAS and whats you name please as I'll have to give that to them as to whom I've spoken with today.

2022-08-04,"I have been playing slots for a good number of years and would expect anyone who losses a lot of money to write a bad review. However I have been playing cleopatra quite frequently on this site for the last 12 months and can honestly say you don’t win anything. Playing £10 spins on cleopatra you would normally expect a win of anything between £500 and £3000 on an average 15 free spin bonus game. The most I have ever one on this site is £150 and that over hundreds and hundreds of games. I stupidly have lost an estimated £20,000 over 12-18 months and have never had a single win more than £200. On other sites I could lose 2 to 3k playing the same games but would eventually win big to compensate for my losses. Not on William Hill, trust me you won’t win anything. I would suggest that the site is rigged as it is not paying out at all. To give readers an example I played cleopatra on 3 sites just yesterday, £500 deposit on one site and had £1,400 in the pot at one point but continued playing and withdrew at £500. Another £500 on another site, same game and got up to £710 before losing the lot. And William I can assure you I have never been up after £1000’s in deposits as the bonus game just never pays out. I stupidly after many, many deposits continued playing as I expected a pay day of which never happened. Thanks to William Hill and my stupidly I am now in large amounts of debt. I wish I never gave this site a chance. Avoid.We all get the hump when we lose but i know I expect to lose when gambling, but also expect good win days of which will not happen on this site.",1

I have now been told I have reached a £6000 limit for the year and can’t deposit till end of February 2023.This is absolutely ridiculous as these rules about monthly deposit has just come in this year but really how was I to know your going to cap a yearly limit too. Bit of a joke but hey guess I won’t be playing on here again. I get you have to do what you got to for capping limits but at no point did they email me to say there is a yearly limit.

2022-08-03,The best football online betting site to be honest. I was in Japan when I place a bet and won more than hundred thousand euros against a 1.25 euros bet.There  is no problem when it comes to the withdrawal. The william hill helped me ever since I won the money and the customer service is the best.(FYI you must have a ecopayz account to deposit and withdraw money from the site cos japanese bank system do not support bank tranfer and direct debit from your account)Williamhill is way more better than the Japanese football betting sites such as BIG TOTO because you can place bets while matches are being played,5

2022-07-18,Be aware when taking up there offer of opening a new online account they take your money no problem but when you want to take your money out they want a photo of you holding your passport a photo of a utility bill a photo of you with your user name and a photo of you holding your bank statement with the transaction going out. It’s been a week with me and still can’t get my money out. There saying the documents are not in focus or cropped or not in date.

Obviously cheaper for WH to give me my stake back rather than the winnings. They should not have took the bet like they did.The second one was Netherlands v Portugal womens match when Portugal won a corner then the whistle went, the 5th corner was what i needed to win but WH said THEIR sources only said 4 so no win.

I reviewed the odds I’d taken only to find better odds had since been posted. I took the matter up with Hill’s via online chat.

2022-07-11,All I do is lose money on the slots and then suddenly I am excluded from promotions. I asked why and the answer I got was because I was excluded.,2
2022-07-11,I couldn't create an account. I spoke to customer help to be told I already had an account (they gave me a user name I have never heard of or have ever used) and couldn't have a second. I have never used William Hill and never will as their website isn't fit for purpose.,1
2022-07-11,"This is a review re William Hill online, this is my experience. Experiences in high street shops has been totally different. I recently after a lengthy self imposed ban attempted to reopen my account and after some time a customer service operative contacted me. I felt the questioning was fair to begin with however I happened to mention that an online account to bet with would be ideal as I am now practically housebound due to physical disabilities. The whole mood of the conversation then changed as the operative questioned me on my disabilities and what medication I take for these. I felt this was intrusive but answered because I was brought up that way (to respect people doing their job) the operative then said they’d pass my info on to a supervisor to get my account reopened. Imagine my surprise when I received an email that stated that “due to a business decision” my account would not be reopened. I pondered on this and the ONLY reason I can find is that somehow they assume disability also implies mental issues which would mean I couldn’t gamble rationally and responsibly. I contracted William hill and one of their supervisors even said “we didn’t mean to discriminate you” (I have a copy of this conversation) and it would be dealt with asap. Since when I have had nothing from William Hill except one email saying “it’s being looked into” (I paraphrase) I left it a couple of days went online told “it’s being looked into” waited next day told “it’s being looked into” then I was informed online that this would be dealt with immediately (again I have proof of this) still nothing. William Hill online customer service is literally the worst I have ever encountered. I’ve asked for an apology for their discriminatory behaviour and not heard a word. It’s constant lie after lie after lie. As I said to one operative “you wouldn’t stop a guy in a wheelchair bet in your shop but you’ll stop a guy having an online account because you can’t tell the difference between mental and physical disability. Moral of this is - bet anywhere but if you’re disabled and need advice from William hill customer service DONT tell them you’re disabled. Discrimination is alive and well in 2022 ps. The day after I received a call from William Hill I was called a liar online and that William Hill don’t call anyone (again this came from a so called Supervisor) make of this as you will my friends.",1
2022-07-10,Been betting with William hill for years not to my amazement they are two separate company’s one for betting shops were the is no absolute value what so ever ripping punters off left right and centre specially when they give 4th 5th 6th 7th placing which are only for online betting mugs in the William hill betting shops the is nothing for the punter only staff telling you have to bet online for better odds and better placing horses I have been robbed by William hill for a long time on my placed betting William hill are 2 companies which set out the rules for themselves not for the punters best solution is just keep away from William hill,1

2022-06-27,William hill maybe a big brand on the high street but as for its online management they are disgraceful there staff however are very helpful friendy and understanding they completely lie to you the management and do not understand how betting works e.g i had a football bet of 10.08p for 2931 pounds with all selections up apart from 1 game that was due to kick off My argument is william hill must be able to access peoples bank accounts so please avoid palying with william hill they hit the poor people take off poor people to give to the rich disgraceful back to my argument if i had 1000 pounds in my my bank account 1000  on the opposite outcome to the 1 i needed would have netted me 3600 pounds so either way then i would have made a brilliant profit E.g 1010 would have nailed me 2931 pounds or the 3600 good for a poor disabled person yes surely somebody who understands gambling please respond also senior manager lie to you with transcripted evidence saying you have won and also 2 of william hill competitors said i should have been offered cash out as per fair play and understood where i was coming fromAt the very least i was hoping for a goodwill gesture and asking for them to be sympathetic but no they are not I am convinced that william hill will be a thing of the past the way they treat disabled customers and behave like they do a good amount would have helped me in my life but thats the way it ia these days no one cares they just want you to suffer as much as possible,1

2022-06-21,"Having been a user of the William Hill app for over a decade, I was shocked and surprised to receive an email from them this week saying that my account is being restricted after a review from their 'trading team'. I only ever bet a maximum of £10 a time and over 10 years I am a paltry £16 in profit with them. When I asked for a reason as to why they restricted my account, they wouldn't give me one. I know how shady this industry can be in treating its customers, with many bookies restricting people who win - but I only do it for a bit of fun and am not in massive long-term profit. If I now go to place a bet of £10, most of the time it will tell me I can place less than £2. How is this fair? The regulation of this industry needs to be seriously looked at across the board.",1

I don't bother with any sites now they are cheating everyone by any means possible and it will continue as so much revenue is made through gambling nothing will ever get done to stop it, if you don't feed them they can't grow!!!",1

Bet365 only takes away your cash out option when there's absolutely no chance of a win and that's usually on the last few minutes of a bet. The app is god awful as well very clunky to use and slow, also they claim to have the best odds absolute bs I've compared like for like bets between the sites and bet365 has better ones 9/10 times.

Apparently, I needed to verify my account prior to making bets.Fine - I submitted my bank account statement and passport copy. They would not accept the documents - they needed to receive a full transaction history, going across three multiple bank accounts. They also needed multiple passport copies.They then suspended any gaming concessions on receiving my 2nd bank account statement. There was no reason given.After wasting enough time with WH, I closed my account. In Summary - don't waste your time with WH. There are better, more customer friendly firms out there. Their verification requirements are quite frankly ridiculous and the company is untrustworthy, removing their advertised concessions as soon as money is deposited with them.Avoid.",1
2022-05-15,Really cross with them as my winnings were initially paid out but later on I've noticed that they got mysteriously taken out of my balance. WH said the home and away event on their site were initially set in the wrong order and voided my bet despite the fact it was on the winning team! They didn't want to refund me but I refused to accept their excuse as it was their technical error not mines. Still it is irrelevant since its about the participant not the order of home and away setting that matters. It is outcome based not location based so their reasoning is invalid. Eventually they paid out but in pointless empty credit which would then disappear after usage regardless of any outcome at much high risk just to restore back the real refund.

I’m told constantly there will be email updates however I’ve not received one single email in a week.

I have contacted a small claims solicitor, local MP, local newspaper and will continue my social media campaign. I am not letting this go. Its umlawful, they allowed me to trade under false pretences and this is ILLEGAL. Something must be done. William hill you should hold your heads in shame. This is a disgrace. No ownership taken, no resolution skills displayed, no compassion and again beyond ILLEGAL",1

2022-05-11,"This is a disgrace William Hill. Today I had 5 bets on a Basketball game. Mapua Cardinals v SBC Red lion. At half time they scored a total of 51 points two ways. So I took spread bets and went under 118 be the total score. But this was not going to be enough so I took under 131.5 and 132.5 but they keep scoring. The pattern shows this game is either fixed or not real or computed by William Hill. If you study the photo s you will notice what I am talking about. Disgrace, nothing but robbery. Yes they conned me on all bets. They scored 9 points each in the first Q. But nearly 50 in third Q. Yes my money was there to lose.",1
2022-05-11,Been on William hill for years but recently I find it impossible to get any returns despite me depositing on a very regular basis the slots are taking hundreds of spins to give a bonus and then paying pennies I cannot even bonus book of dead on 10p stake anymore but can get a bonus on a lousy 1p stake still it takes too long to bonus and it doesn't matter what game I try they are all doing the same it honestly feels like all the bonuses have been switched off on here plus the poker is as bad being beaten by bad hands although mine are decent I am honestly wondering why I bother redepositing on here and it's not that they drop any nice cash into regular depositors accounts as a good will gesture I deposited £45 over Friday and Saturday with a promise of 10% cashback on net losses on the promotion yet only received £2.70 despite getting nowhere with the £45 it just does not add up,1

2022-05-10,"literral spent over 10000 minutes gaming, lost alot and hardly given any activation on gaming. of course gamble is risk but that is absolute joke. hardly any activation features on any games and when i did get a couple times won a measurly 20p - 40p (little as a normal spin lol) after alot of deposits, makes you wonder how they are allowed to get away with it programming on their end. so you cannot win. and milk the money outta your bank, unfair gaming in my opinion. this should not be aloud to get away with it., how the goverment allowing them to just get away with it is beyond me. makes you wonder why owners like denise coates makes like £300+ million plus a year.ok sports betting is fine but they gaming how its bugged to make you lose is a disgrace shouldnt be aloud. (is like they have magic button on their end press it so they dont let you win profit :) ) which is most likey true.as for the gaming these jacpots, that show prizes must be one in certain time, how on earth can they predict it gonna be won in a hour, because its FIXED. and when it is won does not say anything about who won it. just say Prize has been won?? by who or do williamhill just pretend act like it won by declaring someone has won? maybe it a won by bot. and william hill has admitted using bot themself in past!!Advice if you do gamble win any profit off gaming quit withdraw, dont play on because they will only milk it off you untill you lose all of it!Advice 2. Pay your bills off. firstly if you have money to lose after and want gamble it away thats your choice. You will get sucked in and lose your hard earned earning to these gambling companies !!!!!!!!",1

I was told to have 24 hours to think about it which I did do next day I tried again to get my account reopened I was told I would have to wait for a call back from them to reopen it . They never called me back so today I tried again I was told that they would call me .

But they have restricted my account without telling me as I no longer get cashouts on any horse bet and the only football cash outs I get is a simple 4-6 fold acca any bigger the cash outs are taken away aswell.

Then later I went back on line to look at the next days racing odds and there in my account 0.00I got in touch to ask what was going on,the horrible person said they had made a mistake by settling the game as btts .They we’re correct it was their error the other game finished 1- nil.So what I can hear you asking It was their mistake surely some courtesy and professional ethics would be to honour their mistake and payout.No way they said they had every right to claim it back.So there you have it,that’s Hills attitude to loyal customers Take heed of this Stay we’ll clear of these horrible people go to Bet365 anywhere but Hills.

2022-04-20,"I have used William Hill for 15 years.

2022-04-20,"All these one star reviews are absolutely comical. Just because you lost to the house, does not mean they are bad company. The house ALWAYS wins, why the fook are you surprised and writing 1 star reviews? Its called ""gambling"" for a reason, you gamble your money on making more money! If anyone gambles in order to try make a profit, they are in a seriously bad patch. Gambling is not about making money, but about enjoy your time. If I want to play a game, I have to pay X amount for it, why is this any different? I have lost money gambling, but equally, I have won money gambling. Overall, the house will always be in profit, but you should be entering a game with the thought of enjoying yourself and if you make money, thats the BONUS. I enjoy table games, roulette, blackjack etc. I know the house has an advantage, I know I will probably lose my deposit, but I play within my limits and ENJOY the games I play. WilliamHill have been one of the best sites I use, their promos are great, Ive won £35 from them for nothing, I've then taken that £35 and turned it into £120 to ""lose"" it all, but I spent 2 full evenings filled with gaming that I thoroughly enjoyed. If you keep losing, why on earth are you continuing to put money into it? You are a gambling degenerate and WilliamHill have ZERO responsibility for your losses, no need to bombard their reviews with 1 stars. People are in complete denial of their gambling addiction it honestly comes across as comical at times. Always enter a deposit KNOWING you are going to lose it all, deposit in the hopes of having FUN not making money. You are all a bunch of donuts if you think you can make consistent profit from gambling (excluding poker as this is probably the only way to make consistent profit)ALSO: if you believe they manipulate pay outs based upon you setting a deposit limit, you are seriously deluded. If you believe UKGC are also paid off to keep hush, you are more than just deluded. UKGC are there to help us, not hinder us. Do you seriously think they would accept ""back handers"" to keep a small number of gambling providers happy? Comical.",4

2022-04-18,The only reason I put one is because I can't put 0. these have got to be the worse bookies there is I've had a issue finding bets I've not placed on my account I reported this 4 weeks ago they froze my account then started saying we've sent you emails which they haven't I contacted the support team and thats a laugh loads of times and they're not helpful at all just lie after lie so I can't get my funds and in no mans land.I saw reviews on here and didn't take notice don't make the same mistake,1
2022-04-16,"This is the worst sports app I have  ever used, bet50 get 50 is total crap, app doesn't work, drove to sports book to initialize and kept saying try later....wasted an hour of my time, I will not give them a dime in the future, they are not the only bookie in town.Don't waste your time like me, their APP is CRAP !!!",1
2022-04-16,Online slots pay out nothing regardless how much you put into them. Odds on football are lower then the other site i use aswell. Not very good at all.,1
2022-04-15,Worst and slowest customer service i have ever had the misfortune to deal with!,1
2022-04-15,"They don't Pay out on winning bets,had a winning bet settled as a loss..Brando the Agent couldn't do anything as I needed to speak to a Boss so what's the point of him being there..Loads of other Book Makers avoid William Hill",1
2022-04-14,THE BIGGEST AND THE WORST!!!It's disgraceful that the largest bookmakers treat the very people who have made them rich with absolute dis respect. They have the lowest and slowest payouts and no customer services.If you are daft enough to give them 1 penny after reading these reviews then go ahead and throw your money away,1
2022-04-14,Stay away from the slots never win anything ever,1
2022-04-14,Absolutely disgusting I played William hill megaways were I triggered the bounce i got ( 12 free spins ×30 multiplayer ) and not reserved them i spoke to customer service were she said i can see you triggered the bounce and not reserved and it wasn't added to you game I will pass this on to are technical team I hat to wait for 3 weeks of constantly asking for my bounce gess what... ye I got nothing even though Angela from customer service could see I never reserved it I was fobed off every time I speak to someone all I got as a good will jester was 10 free spins ..I played 20p a go ( my bounce ther for could of been off first spin LETS say I won 30p × that by 30 exactly and I should of had 12 free spins ×30 multiplayer william hill just rip you off and fob you off.,1
2022-04-13,I think it's very unprofessional to not respond to negative reviews since for customers it's practically impossible to speak to someone. These games on your bingo and Vegas platforms are way below the average RTP on all of them . I played 528 spins at 25p a spin with 1 feature paying 1 pounds then used a different browser and different server spinnned 528 spins again exact outcome . How is this explained it can't be . This is not fair gameplay and does need to be addressed by the powers at be . Goodness knows how much customers are being fraudulently being robbed off on higher stakes thinking these games are checked and verified and playing on correct RTP and rng,1
2022-04-13,"Don't place bets based on any information they give. Put a 4-fold on for £450, one of the games was 0-2 and I placed a bet for over 2.5 and 5 minutes later the game was suspended which lasted for about 30 minutes and when it was fixed the score was 0-1 and after 2 minutes the game was suspended again. Asked if they could void the game from my betslip as I wouldn't have placed the bet had I known only 1 goal had been scored to which their reply was basically that they don't do that and they are not obligated to give you correct information",1
2022-04-12,The fact that No one cares about you and zero response is actually great. Let's hope they Poff  enough people off so eventually this absolute joke of a company closes down once and for all. They have been taking the P for way to long now. Absolute trash customer service run by bots and no managers to talk to. If you complain they ban you! I cannot wait for the online sites to close just like their grubby highstreet shops.  They know they are going down so also avoid mr green because its run by the same company.,1
2022-04-12,"If you encounter issues with your online account, their web chat system is shocking, they take an eternity to reply and I found myself contacting them on three separate occasions which equated to a few HOURS. On each occasion they advised me that they would email me back, which never happened.I also tried to email them through their support email address, however all communication is rejected with an automated response.Absolutely disgusted with their service. Without customers you will not have a business!You only have to look at the reviews posted here, we can’t all be wrong.The common decency of a response should always happen. Probably finished with online betting, but after 50 years of betting with WH, you no longer deserve my betting stakes in the future.",1
2022-04-11,"I have been a credit account customer for over 50 years, always paid my account on time and never ever had a problem until now.They contacted me and told me they weren’t continuing with credit account customers anymore and unless I paid them the money that was outstanding for my ante post bets they would refuse my bets In the future.I explained that with ante post bets one doesn’t settle until the competition is over, that has always been the rules and that was the rule when they accepted my bets.So we are at a stand off because I refused to pay the stake as the competition (Champions League) doesn’t end until May, whereupon, win or lose I will settle.So there is a £400 bet open. They have now had the cheek to do a hard credit search on me.This is the reward for showing over 50 years of loyalty to them. What a disgusting way to treat a loyal and genuine customer.",1
2022-04-11,"I bet £20 each way at 10-1 on Any Second Now in the Grand National. The horse came second. My return? £20. Including the stake! How do they work that out?!!! Their complaints procedure is an online chat with a robot. When you finally get through to a human you just wish you were chatting with the robot again, the service is that poor. Online gambling is manna from heaven for William Hill, as it earns them even more money by scamming the punters.",1
2022-04-11,Have been a regular on bingo for years with William Hill. Never win much but love the chat rooms. If you say anything out of order you get 3 warnings and then suspended for a few days. On Friday someone completely out of the blue berated me. The chat host ignored the harassment I received to my disappointment.  Tonight I asked the same chat host why he didn't step in and issue a warning? He laffed and said I do nothing on the last hour of my shift? Glad the NHS staff don't take the same attitude and you CM Lionel and yes I will be taking this further!,1
2022-04-10,refused to payout even though I had been a loyal customer of 34 years...now I have to get a solicitor involved to get my winnings ..not sure what has happened to this company?,1
2022-04-10,If I could of given it zero stars I would of! Not a single payout after depositing around £250 in a month and not even a £10 win! Totally rigged and will not be using William hill anymore. I know it’s a risk you take if you gamble but not to win even £10 after depositing best part of £250 is a pisstake if you ask me!,1
2022-04-10,Excluded me from the bonus drop no explanation,1
2022-04-10,I am very disappointed from William Hill. I opened an account 2 months ago I put money on the account but they were sending me messages that they couldn't verified my documents although I had sent everything they asked. So cause I was tired of this situation I decided to to withdraw my money back from the same account I put it them. And guess what they are not giving me my money cause they can't verify my documents. I was trying to contact them and asking them to provide me the address of their offices so I can go and show them my documents and to explain me what's the problem and they refused giving it to me. I am so disappointed because probably it's a scam. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,1
2022-04-10,Shocking all round. Bonuses are rubbish. Customer service always automated rubbish. Gameplay is bad. Many play for entertainment but you dont get play time as wins are rare and low at best.,1
2022-04-10,"I have never had an account with them, but yesterday I received an email welcoming me. It was obviously my email, but the username was someone else’s details.Tried replying to say not me etc, tried live chat , no one available. Clicked on a link for I did not request this, takes you to a help page where there is nothing about my problem. Did manage to force a password reset as my email, so hopefully stop any fraud. But impossible to get through to anyone. Surely under GDPR they have duty to sort this.",1
2022-04-09,"I have had a William Hill account for over 25 years and was hacked the other day. I tried to sort the issue out but the company have no live agents to talk to on the phone. Live Chat on the site is terrible as you are constantly cut off before you resolve anything.So, if you are thinking of opening up a William Hill account, you better hope you do not get any problems as trying to sort it out is a nightmare.",1

2022-04-08,every time i try to watch your live racing it either freezes or in some cases it repeats itself  over and over very often it doesn't show the end of the race .I usually have to resort to the radio report to get any sense .I think you should revue your IT servers and put it right,3
2022-04-08,Website is fine but my only complaint is lateness of best odds guaranteed. If they were available the previous evening i would donate a lot more money to William Hill,4

2022-04-07,Out of all the bookies i use and know of some are better for somethings than others but William hill seem to very good on giveaways although on that subject it still could be better. They used to give freespins @ 60p but now 10p that aint good enough to be honest hopefully they can ammend it,5
2022-04-07,I enjoy betting with William Hill. They look out alot for they customer. Great job,5
2022-04-07,I love William Hill usually it is easy to place a bet but I am having trouble at the moment to actually tap on to place a bet as it will not go. There is money in the account but it will not accept it.I am frustrated as I love betting with you,3

2022-04-04,Fake games and never win here. Slots are rare wins but the worst is the evolution games. They are all fake and the spinning wheel is ran by a motor. Google crazy time broken and you will see the wheel spin without aid. Watched 30 spins not hit any 1 in 6 chance then it did it again straight away. So 60+ rolls of a dice without hitting a number. When I complained they told me it’s real and completely genuine. Liars liars liars,1
2022-04-04,"I primarily use the sportsbook, not a slots/casino player. I actually like their product. I do not rate their customer service.I personally made a mistake in not checking my betslip, it turned out that due to an odds fluctuation, the order changed as I prompted the betslip and in a rush I confirmed the transaction. Watched and cheered the horse I thought i had bet win only to frustratingly find out I had bet another horse.I contacted WH customer services an hour later, I only wanted clarification that the order of the horses changed according to the sequence of the odds. I was initially communicating with someone that showed some sympathy for my situation but unfortunately due to the nature of their chat system (it's not live) we were disconnected. I reconnected to an extremely abrupt individual who misinterpreted the scenario and was extremely abrasive in her communication. After asking for a live chat transcript, it came to my attention that she was suggesting, when handing over to a supervisor, that I had felt deceived by their system. This was never stated by myself during the interaction (I subsequently turned down financial offers). I simply contacted them to better understand their system and for some odds information to put my mind at rest. At no point did I ever suggest that William Hill were liable, for anything!What's more, I was told on several occasions (by supervisors) that the order wouldn't change. Despite producing video evidence to the contrary, they maintained their position over several communications. I eventually received an insincere apology and closure of my dispute, with no chance of recourse.Quite incredible that a customer service operation can get this so wrong. I was accused of wanting compensation despite never asking for it, lied to on many occasions (I have retained all communications) and treated with utter contempt. This because they misinterpreted the enquiry and adopted an extremely defensive position from the outset. By the way, this is not the first time it has occurred. There was a dispute over the settlement of a bet, evidence was produced, I was told ""you will not ever be paid out"". I temporarily closed my account only to find some months later that I was indeed paid out... couldn't make it up.",1
2022-04-04,I won £350 on 20p spins on virgin slots after hitting bonus spins. Wllliam hill is an absolute joke I’ve spent a few hundred quid over my time playing here and the bonus spins are an absolute joke paying very little with one bonus spin paying 96 pence at 40p a spin. Many of the other bonus win spins I’ve had haven’t been that far behind either. It’s almost like the slots are rigged to pay out very little. All I can say is keep your money and don’t give it to these rats it’s not a fair game here. Also if you want to bet on sports then you can’t beat betfair for odds as these crooks give very little and considering it’s a competitive market I can’t understand anyone wagering here as you can get much higher odds elsewhere.,1

Such a shame as WH has a good selection of slots that I enjoyed playing.Update: Like a fool, I keep playing. £100's again on 1 game & no bonus, some games need looking into, especially Eye of Horus, WH is a joke now, I don't know how they get away with it!Another Update: Joke, the slots are an absolute joke! several £100's on yet another game & it goes straight through, not a single bonus. I honestly wish I never closed my Betfred account, at least I won big a few times on slots in there. Slots definitely need looking into on WH, nobody can be THAT unlucky on most of the games! Another £160 straight through (& I mean STRAIGHT THROUGH) on slots, I honestly don't know how they get away with it. Has William Hill changed hands or something, they're absolute rubbish. If I have no returns by end of the year (3 weeks) I will close my account completely, they are legally robbing folk!!!!!!",1

I never had expierence like this. Also we counted percentages of wining, tried other sites and only WilliamHill and PaddyPower do same scam if you bet over 50p forget to win over 10x. So i can say there is 1000% that they using something to scam and avoid give people chance to win. I think this video 1000% will prove that here is something suspicious and government will close this and help us kick that rats asses 🤘",1
2022-03-31,I have played live William Hill Roulette for 3 or 4 years now but over the last few days as an example after I have paced my bets £30 first dozen £30 second dozen my bet was moved without me touching anything as the wheel started moving to third dozen instead of first dozen and of which first dozen won.This has happened numerous times of which has probably cost me around £400 over last few days of which William Hills denied any issues their side? But I am afraid they are the ones deliberately moving my bets to losing ones! Never go on William Hill roulette but after a while you will think has someone spiked me or what!!!,1

The bet won, and the top half of the slip was correct, but because the bottom half of the receipt  incorrectly said South Sydney Roosters, of which there is no such team, they voided it. So I phoned the number to ask for it to be reviewed and the lady said someone would phone back. No one ever phoned me back and when I got my mobile bill there was a £9.99 bill for a service charge to their number. So lost £200.00 on the bet and another £9.99 on top.",1
2022-03-27,"I have had an account for over a year. I haven't had any problems until recently. I make deposits every month. Sometimes I end up winning and others I lose. Where my problem is, is the gaming side off williamhill. I regularly win or get offered free spins, which I obviously accept. But after william hill realised I am up by over £300 (not alot but to some people it is!)  They have proceeded to ""restrict"" my account. This means I can't take advantage of ANY gaming promotions. So because I am going to make money in the long term from promotions, I am no longer able to use them. Apparently some companies do this alot to ensure that the house does always win",1
2022-03-29,"The previous review is exactly the same as my experience:' dealing with a company like this.......'I made a bet and won and William Hill have refused verify my account for now given reason.  I am unable to withdraw my winnings.I have done everything William Hill have asked of me, but I continue to receive the same generic email that is not based in reality with no clear instruction.I would avoid this company.  I will update this review if anything changes and give credit where credit is due.",1
2022-03-28,"When dealing with a company like this, you always have to question the intelligence and mentality of the workforce. They are probably low paid, and obviously don't have the decency to care about customers. You might expect to experience dealing with one person who has an incredibly low IQ, but I was misfortunate enough to have to deal with many.Before even being able to play, I was asked to verify my account. I provided the documents, but was asked multiple times to do it again without any clear explanation as to what was wrong. After weeks of trying and waiting, they contacted me to say my account had been verified and was now active. Even though I was able to login to the main section, I wasn't able to login to the play window. It said my account hadn't been verified. I contacted staff again, only to be told with a simple message that my account is now verified. When I tried again, of course it wasn't. I tried and contacted them multiple times but got the same generic answer. Logically, if I'm emailing them multiple times to say I don't have access, then I probably don't. Even long explanations from me were met with the same low grade reply of 'your account is now verified'. Well, obviously it wasn't, otherwise I wouldn't have kept emailing. They made no attempt to check and understand the problem. Instead of looking into it, they just decided to block all access. What utterly bizarre behaviour. So, even though I made a lot of effort and spent weeks waiting, they decided to block me because they don't have the intellect to check whether they fully verified my account.I'm not sure what kind of business strategy they have. It seems that they hate the customers they have, and don't really care about attracting new ones.  Why would you waste someone's time and say it's verified when it isn't? Managers at a normal company would fire such incompetent people, but I suspect not many people wish to work for them. They are stuck with the lowest form of simpletons for employees. I've genuinely never come across so many stupid people. It's of real concern that such people are free in society. There seems to be no way to complain or ask anyone to do such a simple thing as open an account. I was very polite despite being messed around for so long. All I wanted was to start playing after they told me I had been verified. It's not  a major crime. It's probably a relief, because had I won I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to withdraw the money. I'm not sure if there is a reason for anyone to play roulette online, because you will probably never see any wins. If they stumbled over opening my account for weeks, then they will likely block you from withdrawing.I suspect that most of the positive reviews are fake, because the staff seem to be unpleasant and ill-educated. Even if you can play, you likely won't see your money again.",1

2022-03-20,"William Hill like most bookies puts out enticing sportsbook offers around the time of major sporting events to lure in new customers, but don't be fooled into parting with cash, you won't actually ever get to use those offers because virtually as soon as you've deposited money into your account it will be 'locked' indefinitely for mysterious 'security checks', not that this will be explained to you of course without doing your own detective work, nor is it made clear what the purpose of the checks is i.e. is it age verification, money laundering or whatever. You will however spend the next weeks and months sending what feels like all your most personal and sensitive information to william hill including bank statements, payslips, passport, drivers license and many, many photos of yourself - all to try and have £5 e/w on the 3.30 at Cheltenham - I've been accepted for current accounts, credit cards and even mortgages online with infinitely less hassle. All I ever got back from WH was a frustrating loop of emails asking me to send the same documents over and over again and even their customer service live chat helpline wasn't much help as they just parrot the same information back at you... if you ever do get approved the sporting event you were thinking of a bet on will be long, long past so I'd advise saving your money or putting a bet on the old fashioned way in a bricks and mortar shop...",1

2022-03-18,"This is the worst online betting account I have ever held. Today be in the Cheltenham Gold Cup day with about £500 in my account without warning or notice William Hill suspend my account for security checks. I’ve placed a bet literally minutes before this happened. Then go onto the live chat which turns out to no longer be live so you cannot contact them. I ring every number on the Internet for William Hill. They have nobody answering the phones and simply end all calls. They recorded message blames the coronavirus. This is on the biggest day of racing in the year. I can no longer log into my account they have my funds, and they are no longer contactable. A disgrace to the industry.A further update 12 days after the suspension on my account- I have had no contact from William Hill, they have not contacted me to do any checks. I have sent 35 emails and around 40 live chat messages. All return saying ‘they are not the department that deals with this, they will update me in due course’ There are no email addresses for customer service, and no other telephone numbers any longer for William Hill. I have contacted Head Office who again say they will send an email on my behalf. William Hill have literally frozen my account, took my funds, and now ignoring all contact.

They ask for pictures of you holding a current bank statement which is impossible when you have paperless banking. There is no way to speak to anyone on the telephone to explain anything as they apparently only operate a live chat service. Unsure if I will even be able to get my money back from them. An awful service from a company in 2022. It is easier to get a passport!,1

2022-03-17,Bet placed on time money accepted but when it won they claimed the bet was late. There is no option to bet on play nor can you bet after the off as the option is all grey. I am going bro take the matter further and will keep u up dated. My concern is that if the bet had lost they would have simply taken my money with no refund as is was a late bet so they claimed. But bec it won they didt want to pay out. I’m no longer better on this platform and I’m in the process of taking action as this is not acceptable and not fair practice.,1

2022-03-03,"Won a couple quid off the free promotion daily game, bonus drop. They've now banned me from all promotions. What a sham",1
2022-03-03,"William Hill has been having ""technical issues"" for a while now - they do not allow you to phone them....they do not allow you to email them......their ""live"" chat sends you in circles and isnt live - THEY ARE QUICK ENOUGH TO TAKE MONEY OFF YOU BUT WILL NOT RECTIFY THEIR PROLEMS OF THEIR OWN MAKING - DREADFUL !!!!!! Customer service/communication is diabolical - AVOID if you value your patience and money.",1
2022-03-03,"This used to be a good app, free bonus drop was good, hope of winning something, but now excluded, don't know why, maybe they want casual cash from me, I have deposited in the past but still waiting on that win lol, scratch game I get free spins now and again, but when click the opt in link it dont give me the option any more to get 5 free spins, if don't get resolved I will close the account and just use ladbrokes, win more there lol, oh and the joining promotion, I didn't get that either, should have known then lol",1
2022-03-02,"Been with William hill for years and years. Slots are definitely fixed so I gave them up years ago. I was betting sports for a long time and winning the odd £50 here and there but usually staking more. I put a £2 correct goalscorer and correct score on at 100/1 and the bet actually won. I tried to withdraw the money and was stopped because they all of a sudden after years of gambling on their site and hundreds of separate deposits wanted my driver's license, passport,wage slips and many more items to prove who I was. It took me 8 weeks of messing around to eventually get my money. I will never use them again. Nothing but a set of useless, thieving crooks. Customer service is complete and utter joke. These gambling sites never ever ask for your ID when you're depositing. They should be warned off. Never again",1
2022-03-01,"Been using William Hill for years, and have given them thousands in a previous account, going back to 2004 on a game called Heads N Tails.Anyway, they’ve excluded me from the Daily Bonus Drop.While I haven’t deposited anything for a while, I estimate I’ve lost about £300.00 in winnings.And now the most famous bookmaking firm in the UK has seen fit to ban me from a free daily game.Wow….",1
2022-03-01,"Been playing here 2 days now. Spent 700, hit few bonus but then what’s the point. All spins dead spins. Not once did I go up. No excitement no thrills, no way of winning or going up. I don’t mind losing but common free spins and bonuses And petty little wins??? Wether you play on £2 stake or £10 stake it doesn’t matter here, it will pay whatever it was gona pay you on either stake. I say to people stay away from slots altogther it’s not worth it especially not here. Absolutely waste of time.",1
2022-02-28,Ok please take more care with your online updates as I feel if it’s lagging this can affect any wins or pay ratios Needs more work old promotions popping up saying I won and it was apparently an old pop up but found it a day later as new promotion aghggg,3
2022-02-27,I accidentally placed a bet so I contacted William Hill on twitter and they sorted it straight away.,5
2022-02-26,By far the worst site you will ever use to play slots. Been banging away at them for weeks and never had a day where i withdrew any money back into my account. Today i just spent over 600+ spins on Dynamite riches megaways to land a bonus and then it paid out a grand total of £2.34p loool. The slots on this site are clearly rigged as i never have this problem on any other sites i use. Stay well clear and spend your money elsewhere. It's also just bot city when it comes to wanting to communicate with them.  Awful site and i have been with them for years,1
2022-02-26,"Thieves, hands down the worst company I’ve ever had the displeasure of using Signed up on the bet £10 get £40 free bet, signed up no problem and bet the £10 which lost, didn’t get my £40 in free bets credited and had to spend half hour being passed around departments on live chat, finally were credited and bet £40 on a horse, the horse won and AS SOON as it did they suspended my account?!?Vile, thieves, criminals",1
2022-02-26,"Out of all the Mainstream Betting outlet's I must say that William Hill are the biggest bunch of Scam Artist's I have ever known, the Slots are the most Rigged out of all of them, it's absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to profit here. I have tried about 10 seperate occasions now and the RTP is set at around 6% lol and that's not even a joke. I have NEVER EVER been able to make a single withdrawal with these Con men. The ONLY way to make a small profit on William Hill is to NOT play ANY of the Slots and just log in once a day for the Free Daily Bonus drop, you can win up to £1 a day just logging in and doing the drop. But just log out after and DON'T TRY THE SLOTS!!!!!",1
2022-02-25,Absolutely been robbed by these... would not recommend at all closed my account with a balance of over £100 in... every time I speak to them on chat I get fobbed off saying they will send me a email about refund but never received.,1
2022-02-25,"Faceless, invasive, shocking support.Make you jump through ridiculous hoops and share personal and financially sensitive information  to access your money in the name of anti money laundering. Customer support give pre canned responses which do not answer the questions or help at all (simply asking to explain what I need to do as you keep rejecting my documents). They don't even acknowledge what you're asking. Awful.",1
2022-02-24,open account and asked for several documents and I asked to close the account and return £10 deposited.  They don't want to return.  ask for more and more documents.  absurd.,1
2022-02-24,I have used Willhill for poker for over ten years and never had an issue. Skrill withdrawals would take 4 hours exactly.Now its a week apparently for skrill and support telling me I reversed a withdrawal which I didn't.,2
2022-02-23,poker is an absolute joke. not gonna go down the rigged route but play on here for any length of time and you know what im talking about. random? yeah right! a computer game no more no less and a shiite one at that. if you like a serious game of poker avoid this cartoon garbage at all costs.,1
2022-02-23,"I made the mistake of trying to take advantage of a new customer / enhanced odds offer (scam). I registered, made my minimum deposit (£10) via paypal, made the £1 bet at 25-1 (enhanced odds) and everything was rosy until I went to log back into the website to use my winnings. It wouldn't allow me to log-in. It referred me to my emails, upon which I noticed a badly-worded, cheaply-presented email from willhill.com in my junk mail. It asked me to send them a variety of documents & photos, including a selfie with me holding my drivers licence and a handwritten note with my username on. They also wanted proof of address in the form of a bank statement, which showed the deposit. So...after confirming that it was actually a legal requirement for them to obtain this much info, I sent it. But it's never right. ""The picture isn't clear enough."" (Has anyone tried to take a photo of themselves holding paper and a driving licence?) The camera automatically focusses on one's face so the document details are always slightly out of focus. ""The bank statement isn't right"" even though I sent them a pdf of it and highlighted the £10 transaction. It wasn't right because I paid with PAYPAL! So I sent them a pdf of the Paypal transaction, which also showed that it linked to my bank account. But it's still not right - no idea why. And, of course, the photos still aren't clear enough.So, now they can F right off and keep the £10 I deposited along with the £25 winnings because I give up trying to verify myself. It's strange that they needed no info at all before I deposited some funds into their account! Clearly it's more important for William Hill to separate punters from their £10 than to actually have a new customer.Having read several pages of reviews similar to mine, it seems as though this is a common scam that William Hill like to commit.",1
2022-02-23,"What has happened to William Hill, I've been with them for years and it's all gone down hillYou can no-longer get through to a human being at William Hill online, I have been waiting for a withdrawl of £800 for over a week now and have emailed several times, had to go on thier ridiculous ""not live"" chat and still nothing.  I've had to re-submit proof of who I am etc which I fail to grasp...As soon as this is sorted i'm off to a proper company like, Coral, Sky or Ladbrookes - don't waste your time with these as you'll become super frustrated if you have an issue.To update - just wasted an hour on this again - If you do manage to get through to a human on chat, they go through a bull crib sheet which still end up no-where",1

2022-02-22,Shocking on the promotion sides of things I recently opted in to a promotion called 10% back on net losses I’ve been waiting all day today checking it on and off to see if they have credited meWith the money that I am rightly entitled to and still have not received it contacted customer services they basically called me out to be a liar when playing games also the slots freeze and crash and then kick me out or restart the game it’s just all in all shambles to be honest though I know it’s only a little promotion but I’ve recently contacted the gambling commission because William Hill don’t treat their customers fairly I also see William Hill or replying to only good reviews and never to bad reviews to me and to anyone who has got any brains that just says it all they need ******* off and closing down the ********,1
2022-02-22,Amazing support Twitter support is especially good first class,5
2022-02-22,Had an account with them for years for small football bets with no issues. Built up a balance and they then decided to steal my money and close the account without my knowledge. Contacted them for last month on numerous occasions. Promised call backs but no one ever does. Have asked to log as complaint but they just ignore me. Shocking customer service. Just want my stolen money back and a complaint logged. Would not recommend.,1
2022-02-21,"App doesn’t work in the middle of the night for an hour because of “maintenance.” It has fewer wagering options then going into a Sportsbook. App also has been down at critical times, due to high traffic, causing me to not get in a bet.The low grade is primarily due to poor customer service. There is no phone number to call, and you have to use a chat device that just took me 20 minutes to wait, and they were unable to help much. I have a WINNING BET that they failed to grade and they said it would take up to 2 days. I do NOT RECOMMEND",2

2022-02-19,"Accepting bets and voiding matches few minutes later without giving people the option of a refund or to continue with the reduced potential return. What the heck am I doing with a potential return £3.45 for a 20 accumulator bet? Give me the option to cancel my bet if matches have been cancelled. Out of 20 matches I bet on, 8 were voided. I didn't want to reduced return, I wanted my money back. I chose 20 matches, give me 20 or my money back.",1
2022-02-18,"Happened several times, they voided tennis which ended up in normal way... Spent hours on few occasions to get it right",1

After 6 days their website says they are having an issue with withdrawals, wouldn't it be courtesy to email customers to let them know......",1
2022-02-17,I made my first withdrawal via Skrill on 11 Feb.  it's been 7 days now and they still haven't sent me any money.  Extremely bad online support.  they usually end up chatting when I'm asking.  Sincere advice should not participate in betting at this bookie,1

2022-02-17,"William Hill is a con! The bonus round hardly ever triggers and when it does, it pays out less than you put in. Rubbish site.",1
2022-02-16,Suspended my account twice and refused to pay me back my funds. Requested selfies of me holding my passport and username still refused to pay me out once I supplied this. I have taken my complaint further as I now believe William Hill is targeting my account as this has happened twice now I have supplied all documents but they just won’t pay me my funds. I have also written to the CEO as I am struggling financially and mentally  as a result of them holding my funds without good reason. This experience has made me not want to use an online bookie ever again.,1

2022-02-15,hi .i have been with william hills for many years and not just a casual player i have spent thousands over the years .but this morning i played the £2.00 free bonus on money drop live .the first game 5 20p bets no win the second round same again and it came in 0n 1000 x which to me is £200 before i could put any money on the drop part of the game the screen went back to the main casino screen with a banner saying you can rejoin the game after the live play when i did rejoin the game i somehow won £8.00 without putting any money on on the second spin i upped the stake to £1.00 and put it on 250 x plus a couple of others .it came in and the 250 x also came in as a x 2 making it 500 x so i should have had £500 pounds to put on the drop guess what it didn't even acknowledge i had won the £500 pound on the spin and gave me no money to play on the drop.i have complained to william hill through live chat waste of time offered me £5.00 good will.please stay away from william hills total cons i will be betting somewhere else in future,1
2022-02-14,This bookmaker cannot be trusted to settle bets correctly. They have two bets as losers costing me £1900. I have provided information that shows they’re incorrect but they do not care. They now refuse to engage and are keeping the money. They’ve told me that I have to contact OPTA would have provided incorrect statistics. OPTA do not respond to my emails. Absolutely shocking behaviour. I am pursuing through arbitration. I can safely say I will never use this bookmaker ever again. Appalling. Do not ever use their terminals for bets that you cannot verify easily.,1
2022-02-14,Stopped me from depositing on their site because they decided i had a gambling problem then gave me a £5 free bet. Worst customer service experience I've ever had.Truth is i win more than i lose and they don't like that.,1

Went on my account details to check my deposits and withdrawals and guess what I'm   -2700£ yes its over a few years but comes to show how dangerous gambling is and how easy it is to keep loosing your money just so they can get rich. Never again",1
2022-02-11,The sign-up process is absolutely ridiculous. I won with my first bet and then they wanted literally more personal information than you need to get a passport just to access my account. They wanted 2 different bank account statements! Absolutely mental. And even then my details were rejected and my money I guess is lost.,1
2022-02-11,"Document verification process takes forever and is increasingly complicated! I'm trying to retrieve my deposit of £10 and winnings of a couple pounds but they locked my account and initially only required scans of passports, bank accounts and a username handwritten on paper. Now, they want all of that plus a selfie of all of the above plus another bank account to show funding into that bank account and an overview page of the accounts. What's next - biometric testing, HMRC tax receipts, payslips and social security numbers? These guys had no intention of returning your money!",1

After a while I grew tired of the whole charade and decided to close my account. But that proved to be quite difficult, too. Turns out William Hill won't let you withdraw your own money until you provide them with every single document they might desire. Didn't matter that I'd never placed a single bet with them and just wanted to close my account, still had to send them all of my personal documents. Customer service was rude and dismissive, too.Just to be clear, I don't mind them having rigorous security policies, just wish they'd made it clear *before* they let me deposit money in my account. Had I known I needed to jump through so many hoops I never would've signed up in the first place.",1

2022-01-23,"bad odds, bad offers, spamming gambling offers. bad service.Next to no customer service just a bot repeating the same thing over and over.  Where most sites let you withdrawn same or next day, william hill will keep the money for days untill they send it out. There's no easy way to see the withdraw amounts either, you have to scroll through a tiny menu through alllll the bets till you find the withdraw amount. Very shoddy, bad UI. Will not use again.",1

2022-01-20,It would be good if you could talk to them and get them to explain themselves. I had a call from some sort of welfare officer because I don’t make many withdrawals. I took out a few hundred and immediately had bets limited to a few coppers. There is such hypocricy. They use the pretense of protecting addicted gamblers to limit people who win.,2

2022-01-18,"Update. 2 weeks later. Spent many more hours on live char being promised a phone call ""from relevant team"" and still had no phone call. So my account remains suspended with nearly £800 in winnings. I can't understand how WH get away with their extraordinary poor customer service. Its astonishing. I noticed someone had accessed my account and removed my payment methods and tried to add his own, so he could withdraw my balance. Fortunately I had a deplim on and was unable to deposit at the time.You are unable to speak to anyone on phone at william hill (a business decision apparently) so you have go via live chat. This live chat is the most tedious experience I've ever been through. After waiting 20-60mins for the virtual to find an actual human, the human assistant leaves such huge gaps between replies it's like a whole day evolution. My issue is still ongoing as I sit impatiently waiting on a reply from them over my account that is currently suspended with my substantial balance.",1

I clicked on the given link and Error 11 came up again.This slot won't play on my iPhone 12 or my tablet so why haven't William Hill removed it from the promo or fixed the fault which I've reported almost EVERY DAY FOR 3 WEEKS!!!!!Appalling customer services",1

Just a disgraceful site.played Goonies return quite a lot on William hill and I haven't seen 1 bonus or seen the skull flash green once blatantly rigged as I've played same game on other sites and it plays fairly.for a big name William hill is an absolute disgrace to humanity. Deposited 7 days in a row and all I've got is dead spins Penney wins and one bonus of £1.45 this is without doubt THE WORSE CASINO SITE OUT THERE every slot plays so bad. more chance of seeing a fuc@ing unicorn than a bonus if you do somehow manage to land a bonus it's the smallest bonuses I've seen on any site.by far the worse bookmaker and casino site in the UK. I got odds of 8/1 for Conor coady to score for Everton v Liverpool all other bookmakers he was between 12/1 and 16/1 just absolute disgusting disgraceful scummy thieves",1

2022-01-08,Games are corrupt to the core. I'm losing on average about £50 every game I play. Its virtually impossible to win on the normal gameplay so its all about the bonuses and free spins. You can play for hours losing a lot then get a 15 spin bonus which then pays between £2 and £10. This is basically the norm with their games.,1

2022-01-05,"I used William Hill regularly over the last year and they intitially provided generous promotional offers for people who bet on football and occasional races like myself. I was sent a survey asking me to rate the promotional offers and if I was happy with the services. Within weeks of submitting this, I was banned from all promotions and free bets, as well as having my stakes entirely restricted. In the email I received, I was informed that I had ""used a bonus or promotion that goes against our terms and conditions"", though William Hill have been unable to explain what exactly I'm supposed to have done. The email additionally stated that I would be able to use all of their betting and gambling products as usual, however I cannot place a bet for more than a couple of pounds, so this was clearly untrue. It is highly unprofessional of William Hill to accuse customers of misusing promotions and then fail to provide an explanation as to how they came to this conclusion, and send emails falsely claiming betting services can be used as normal. I cannot understand how it makes business sense to entirely restrict customers' stakes and prevent them being able to bet at all, but as this account is basically useless, I will unfortunately be looking elsewhere.",1

They want to know everything about you. PS you won't get your money.,5

They just block your account say from depositing but no one tells you why , they waste hours of your time before you find out all they want is wage slips .  Why not send an email requesting these instead of just blocking a d leaving the robot to fend you off.I understand bookmakers have gambling responsibilities and have no issues sending in wage slips but please improve your communication.For people thinking of opening an account bear in mind this bookmaker want wage slips, p60s, bank statements etc within two weeks of you using them .

2021-11-23,Shocking discovery today learning that this company have 2 sets of prices “in shop” you can have over the counter(otc)price or a machine price.The machine price is normally bigger than the otc price.This means they are cheating any customer wanting prices otc.They are especially cheating the older generation who could bet their yankees etc on the machines but choose the old fashioned way.Another example is say you want £10 single on a horse and it’s 9/2 otc price but the machine price is 5/1.This means your return is either £55 or £60 thus otc customer loses out on £5.What then makes this worse is the shop staff are unaware that the machine price is bigger unless they go and check but they can’t because they are working alone..,1

Interruptions during live streaming of dog/horse racing - effectively missing the race(s) I’ve wagered on2. Winning bets voided because they were placed after scheduled off time 3. Opting into daily promotions only to find that the “free bets” weren’t always applied automatically - meaning I had to waste more time chasing this up through live chat4. Extremely poor customer service when contacting WH through live chat. The initial Will robot is a joke and the service agents leave a lot to be desired. Very little compassion/sympathy on display and it’s almost as if they could’ve give a hoot. All in all, an extremely sad state of affairs. WH are a million miles behind some of the leading lights in the industry. Needless to say, although a loyal and frequent customer, I don’t feel valued and will be leaving for pastures new.

Sign up was easy, opening offers good, and I enjoyed placing Accumulators on their site as they have Acca Insurance (1 leg lets you down, you get your stake refunded). Plus the Acca bet club each week was a motivator to me to use them. However, I started winning. When a punter does this, bookies dont like it. They no longer want you to use their offers, promotions etc. I was stake restricted and offer banned. All because of the following: I placed an Acca, one leg failed, I got insurance (stake returned), I placed the free bet on a horse that won. Im now in credit. I now get the email saying they no longer want my business. I strongly advise to stay away.",1

2021-11-05,"Mix views on the whole experience. Some of the odds are slightly lower and are fixed prices for example a horse rompped in at 50-1 the other day but Billy Hills was fixed at 33-1. I have also had on over 3 seperate occasions where I have had to contest the betting result and only got paid out once properly. I wouldnt mind but im not big gambler im only talkin the odd 10 pound and that, which only gets put back on anyway and is hardley penuts compared to 9.1m profits made last year. I do like all the different games tho and is a good varaity of spins, drops and bingo games... also like the live casino bit snd the different games in there, but there is alot going on and can get sucked into all the flashing lights and excitment. The best bit I must admit is the gambeling controls and the ability to bar yourself and thake breaks. It always seems like to me here is a load of free spins n drops to get u hooked, but then if u get too much for you we will help... its like running you over with an ambulance. Overall I do enjoy the experience and it is really good fun.",4

About three weeks ago you decided, without warning or explanation, to stop me ever getting an offer from scratch of the day. I complained, and what made it even worse was that your representative lied to me, and told me it was just chance. When I get an offer every day for a year or more, then fail to get one for the next three weeks yes it could, theoretically, be chance, but we both know it wasn't, and I do not like being lied to.

2021-10-27,"Visited like I have done over the years William hill sale. Placed the same bets as I always do totalling 50.00 or more each visit all bets placed before 12 and I take best odds. And right down all the prices. I had a place at 6.1 which returned 11.1 and a 18.1 winner that returned 33.1. but I never received the boosted odds. So when I enquired why not, they said because I did not have coral reward card. Why in all of the months before of placing the bets, did no staff member ever pull me up and say you write best odds on your tickets all of the time. But you would not be entitled to best odds. Or when they take the bets of me for them months prior and they see b o g written on all of my bets did they not once confront this clear error. And when it becomes a clear error on there side. They refuse to pay out at the best odds. It is not the measily amount it is the principle. And then to be insulted by ignorant members of staff, makes the situation far more serious. I even have a video of this incident and  I will be uploading it to my Facebook account so you are more than welcome to come view this incidentwhere you will even hear  the assistant with girls green hair clearly say he has never served me   as  I am in possesion of 5 losing reciepts with his name clearly on the tickets.  And fully understand that it is TRUE that you will never win ever with these reneging professionals. Do all of yourselves. Your families your friends your loved ones. A big favour.

I had to send 7 months bank statements, passport, ID Card, Copy of Debit Card, Copy of Credit Card, Copy of all my income….I sent the items quickly and told them to pay money back to my card and close the account. William Hill made me wait three weeks four days before sending my money back to my card. This firm is not to be trusted…they are liars and very deceitful. I had a Spanish lad phone me at my request I think he had just left school and spoke only ‘pigeon’ English and although he was a nice lad I.

I would like to thank William Hill for the William Hill Excrement Experience and they showed me all the reasons why people should NEVER BET WITH WILLIAM HILL….liars, cheats, impolite and ignorant to the core. They returned my money after 25 days holding it ‘Hostage’",1

You can only chat online, firstly to a robot, then I think to a human, that can’t give you any real answers, except say they will look into it, then again you hear nothing.

2021-10-20,William hill and other betting shops and sites in the uk have been robbing the public for years! So I put the shoe on the other foot and I rob then. I go all round the country waiting for a daft unintelligent student who works there part time and do ambiguous bets 😀😀 it works 75 percent of the time and I make a good profit 😀😂😂 nothing better than robbing these evil billionaire corrupt scum bags specially hills and the fat scum bag Fred don from betfred 😀😀 also like to say keep up the good work to sir Barry Conway and sir Neil Cole 😀😀😅,1

Getting the usual ""please bare with us"" by the incompetent live chat agents that take 20 minutes to answer a simple question. One thing is sure as soon as my winnings are in my account I will be cutting ties with that poorly run site.",1

They were ok with me placing a bet, but not with me trying to collect. Not that it mattered much but I was wearing a mask when I came back the second time and on my way to the security station there were dozens of patrons not wearing masks. I felt singled out because I spoke out to the clerk and her substantial cohort (again a generous depiction) on how worthless I feel the mandate is.

2021-10-13,"I'd only kept my account with these chancers open for sports (mostly football) betting but i've closed it now as i've absolutely had enough of their antics. Apart from the blatantly rigged casino games their ""in-play"" option for normal real-world betting absolutely CANNOT be trusted. They claim to rely on third-parties to provide accurate up-to-the-minute information on whatever their customer's bet on and, because of this, they won't be held accountable for any 'mistakes or delays'. This may well be the case but it doesn't excuse the fact that, after placing bets, they'll often remove the ""cash-in"" option for unjustifiably long periods, even in matches they're streaming live & it's transparently clear there's no reason to do so. I can't help thinking they do this in the hope they'll catch out punters expecting a safety net, only to pull the rug from under us in the hope our bets end up losing. This has happened to me far too many times now so i don't feel comfortable placing such bets anymore. I've had ""cash-in"" options removed for 30 minutes, 45 minutes & longer without any rhyme or reason.",1

I had the option to have a £5 free bet if I placed a £10 bet on football, I however forgot to tap ""opt in"" and thought I'd missed the opportunity, I went to messenger, gave a short message, explained I'd placed a £40 bet, missed the opt in and was there anyway they could help me with my mistake, the friendly customer service representative checked my details, clarified the facts and swiftly gave me a £10 free bet, £5 more than stated as good will gesture to a faithful user and customer, I thanked the kind person for their understanding, fairness and goodwill gesture, This is why I'll always stick with William hill, Great service, great app, great staff, and quick withdrawal when you win, Get in !

Even at £2 stakes, the stakes they limited me to, I was still considered a threat to their bottom line.

2021-09-25,"i actually need to call gaming to see if i'm being scammed. in less than 3 weeks it has refused dozens of bets that would have won, but never a loser. how is that possible? the site goes down endlessly. if you try to bet a middle in game ur screwed. you only get the side that loses. it won't let you get ur other side in but once in 5 bets if ur lucky. the worst form of betting i ever known of since my first 10 cents bet in 4th grade on the super bowl. i feel like i was absolutely robbed from this company! however, by knowing what bets not to let me make, it must be fixed for that to happen over and over again every time. just not logically possible. also, i checked other websites and there was no connection problem. i don't know about other apps, but i never seen this kind of horrible consistency ever. don't bet in-game with this app unless you absolutely hate money!",1
2021-09-24,"Great help, fast and super helpful",5
2021-09-24,"I find using this site very easy and the customer service is very easy and quick , the social media is especially enjoyable , and i especially enjoy their offers :)",5
2021-09-23,Avoid at all costs.. will just rob you of your money once it has give you small wins. It will just take it all back plus more.. games glitch are the time aswell so have to re start them  Customer service are just rude and unhelpful expecily supervisor Maris. Why I have spent so much money on this site is beyond me.. much better sites out to use than this one,1
2021-09-22,Playing on 2 different slots games I won 33 free spins And between them won 1.10pA complained and got told games are correct This is a rip off site I moved to bet365 at least there you can win something it took 1 hour for a reply Load of rubbish don’t join here,1
2021-09-22,i used to use them years ago in two years i won three times small amounts each time i tried to withdraw winnings they closed account had to ring them each time and they would open account and deposit money third time they wanted me to send proof thank god i never had a big win how do they keep going. they advertise like there great,1
2021-09-22,Been betting with this company for years and all of a sudden they want verification bank details with Iban and bank letter head etc . I am totally happy at this but the time they are taking and the fact they have rejected the statement I sent in as it’s not got a letterhead when plainly it does as it’s a official bank statement is laughable. To make matters worse customer service is terrible nobody can tell me if document is now accepted and the response time is horrendous . Meant to be a big betting company but smaller companies are so much better get it sorted William hill . Waiting on £3500 withdrawal in the mean time this has been going on for 4 days . Ridiculous,1
2021-09-22,"Willhill keep playing with words on most things, you walk in a betting shop and they advertised 25 great offers so I ask this GREAT FOR WHO some time you see winners like 2 out of 25 or one out of 25  and a lot of times no winners at all.. Online with the top golf the advertise Top Prices Gtd on all top 10 in the betting which is not the CASE. Best odds should mean best odds not the same and not lower or change their wording",2
2021-09-21,Never had a problem with money won and withdrawn!!But the bonus drop is just bait and rubbish!! There's 888 and there the worst online company ever!!Will hill ain't as bad as some.,4
2021-09-21,"absolute cowboys! refusing to pay out on a winning bet!! Manipulated the bet slip to suit, claimed a game was firstly postponed, when they realised that it wasn't then decided to say it wasn't part of their promotions ""game week"". Disgrace of a company!",1
2021-09-20,Worst site ever pays out couple of quid and then takes straight back same small group of people that win on bingo all the time horrible site never be back,1
2021-09-17,Honestly never had a issue. Ive got cousins who have constantly won grands. I too have won but have lost too! I dont waste alot of money usually place football bets and play roullete now and then. Only change is when i used to loose money id get either a % back or just over what i lost and would get some back in promotions but now i barely win anything on promotions. They have always paid me out and if i cash out early hours i recieve next day,4
2021-09-17,"Very disappointed as they cancelled the two promotions I used , Scratch of the Day and Four from Six with no explanation!I requested a call and they refused.Just used to make small bets as a bit of fun.Very disappointed at my treatment!",1
2021-09-17,I've spent thousands with this company now I've made a withdrawal or tried to should I say they are so slow to pay out it been 5 days and still not processed my withdrawal even tho I've did everything they asked and sent in statements just get fobbed off on live chat they have no trouble taking people's money tho,1
2021-09-16,QUICK ENOUGH TO TAKE YOUR MONEY BUT WONT PAY YOU OUT don’t really bet but won on a £1 football bet over £1000 anyway they have now closed my account due to business decision and won’t pay me out…… AVOID,1
2021-09-15,"Never done a review before but just need to ask if anyones had an actual ""game"" out of the slots. I know there's never any winners in gambling and don't expect to be winning bundles or ever beat the bookie but I've been playing for months and months daily and not little amounts of money either. But have only had an odd ""win"" here and there (wouldnt call them a win to be honest just a fraction of what I've put on to play that day). Very rarely have I had any bonus features and when I have its paid out like 1.20 or something silly. I've played other sites gala paddy etc and have atleast had abit of entertainment out of it. At one point I wondered if the site/app was broken. Cant be right? Think ill give this site up.",1
2021-09-14,"Customer service is really good.Thoroughly enjoyed using the app, don’t really gamble that much, but like having a little flutter on the rugby, for the Six Nations.Just a shame at the moment they’re unable to offer The Greenking IPA Championship rugby games, as would like to have a flutter on those, but oh well. I’ll just save my money for the Six Nations and Autumn International games.",5

I have filled out there surveys and gamble more than them and have been in touch with WH but apparently it's random!!! I only use the site because of the quick cash but I've had enough",2
2021-09-08,"I think you have some amazing bonuses but searching for games on your app is really hard. You guys need to have a more friendly app. I don’t know what happens but you can click on a match and they will go like ‘page not available’ I just don’t understand. You guys need to fix all those bugs n make sure it’s easy to navigate. You will see a match and they will give you sub headings like : goals, scorers, handicaps etc but when you click on it nothing happens. I’m giving you 5 star because of your promotions. I hope you check on other companies it’s not always that you need to be different.",5

They expect all of us to have driving license and Passport, well  William Hill we don't have that privilege, Stop stealing our money and claiming our documents are invalid, you should respect every country's documents, when I deposited 20 dollars you didn't say my Bank was invalid, or my Mastercard is invalid, the same ID you say is invalid is what I used to sign up for the bank you stole my 20 usd from, when depositing no problem, when withdrawing they start sending rules in live chat, and blocking my account with my money in it, use human verification just like other bookmarkers, bet365 accepted my ID, Betfair accepted my ID but you claim it's invalid, block your address from our countries if you don't want us to bet with you, for stealing my hard earned money, I would give half a star but that is not possible.",1

2021-09-02,william hill .I can not understand  when in your betting shops and you play the slots. If you play 20p bets you win a lot more then when you play a 2 pound spin.  I have been  experience this over the last year.  especially when you get on the bonus spins. Please please dont say this is R.N. becouse its not.

2021-08-31,"Quite frankly the customer service that a company this size offers is a complete and utter joke.The livechat representatives are poorly trained and do everything in their power to stonewall you and make you feel like rubbish.I honestly do question whether the majority of operators first language is English, as at times it really is like speaking to a child.I have wagered thousands with themselves in the past few months, but as of last week have opened an account with BET365 and have been making my bets there.I have openly asked several times before events start for assistance on bets, and I've either been point blank lied too with false promises that someone will be in contact, or just blatently ignored.I specifically opened a twitter account to try and seek assistance as the livechat route was so extremely unhelpful. I sent 24 tweets and 7 dms over a period of 6 days. I never recieved one response, yet looking at people asking for odds they where responded too in minutes. @wilhillhelp what a joke that twitter handle is seriously.Anyway I digress the final straw came recently where a livechat rep refused to assist me before the event started only saying my match would be settled based on sofascore result, they wouldnt accept any information  from the either teams official website they wouldn't accept any information from the governing bodies official FA sight either, these where both classed as unofficial sources, however sofascore was...Anyway, as it transpired sofascore once the match had finished changed their information to reflect that of the official sources I had tried to give previously. Guess what, WH now refuse to change my bet, stating they have other sources for settlement, ones they won't reveal.So despite me giving countless information they refuse to pass any of this information a cross to the traders.Its so annoying because in the long wrong I know I will win, even if I have to take it to IBAS.The football official governing body, the teams official websites and social media pages, and the now once sacred sofascore once the official source but now disregarded as it backs me up all have the same information, which basically states the match was played at the away teams home ground.William Hill, I really don't know what's wrong with you guys, but you have now lost a very loyal and regular customer.",1

I didnt have any problems until one night i gambled about £100 on the slots, i thought i'd won a major jackpot, the game crashed & the next morning i got an email saying my account had been suspended indefinately...no explaination, no nothing...steer clear, they will find a way not to pay, will hill? More like dick turpin.",1
2021-08-30,"I’ve never once moaned about gambling but this is just beyond, you put money on and it goes straight down on the slots, no one expects to win every time you put money on but this is some sort of joke?

Through lock down they must of reduced there pay out rates which is terrible, I would recommend people stay clear of this site, and also I placed a football acca a week ago and it wouldn’t let me cash out it’s disgusting, William hill are really going down hill stay clear",1

2021-08-27,Sorry I just wrote wrong review the issue I have with William hill is I joined up deposited my money but didn’t get a welcome bonus I can’t get through on chat line just goes in a circle back to log in it’s crazy can’t get anyone to do anything they was quick enough to take my money but won’t give anything I just noticed that William hill have replied to any positive reviews but ignore any problem instead of assisting the customers who have issues with them it’s disgusting. I still cannot get through to customer service to get my bonus which I am entitled to surely,1
2021-08-27,The issue that I have experienced was: I placed a bet in william hill on distance of horse winning and it won. I took my bet to the counter and the staff refused to pay me as they did not know how to settle it and said I had to do it on a special slip. I was not told this at the time of placing. The staff said all I can do is return your stake money which is why I'm making this complaint as its complete ridicule. The staff are so incompetent in that shop and were not customer service orientated. Worst experience ever,1
2021-08-27,Awful. I won £300 on bingo jackpot. Sent every bit of verification via email and yet they kept asking for the same documentation over and over again. Live chat agent froze my account because I mentioned their lack of response was making me anxious. I am reporting them to the Gambling Commission.,1

2021-08-26,"William Hill is clearly pursuing a policy of freezing people's accounts without providing a suitable reason, masquerading under the guise of 'anti-money laundering'. Their apparent abuse of this regulatory instrument seems absolutely clear. What strikes me, from my research into this, is that they are the worst of the main bookies taking this bogus hardline against customers. The numerous reports of William Hill effectively stealing people's balances and not paying them once they've been provided sufficient (albeit exaggerated) quantities of documentation are not a coincidence. Also, is it a coincidence that accounts are limited and banned as soon as account controls are used? I think not. The veil will be lifted at some point - we must work together to make people aware of this torrid business practice. I am compiling information to forward to MPs, news outlets and other key stakeholders. This must not be left uninvestigated for any longer.",1
2021-08-24,"Tried to sign up as a new customer, I added the code for £50 free bets, my account was instantly frozen and no communication as to why, the only email I received was from a suspicious email that simply read your account has been frozen. May be coincidence but my email was also frozen for suspicious activity at the same time. I then spoke to someone via chat box, where they explained I needed to give ID, and the code for free bets hadn’t been accepted so I wouldn’t get the free bets… so I decided it wasn’t worth it but thanked them anyway, to which the very professional response of: alright mate 😉 The entire experience screamed dodgy",1

2021-08-05,"Please read carefully since my review will be as objective as it can be and it may save you from making a severe mistake and have a hard time.I played a lot at William Hill for years and I was convinced that there was no match to them. As for verification, I was requested the usual, Id and address proof.Now, a few months ago, for some obscure reason, these guys switched their gambling authority from Gibraltar to Malta. This alone, doesn't mean much to me since there is a tradeoff between the quality of the regulator and how much they will harass you with papers (i.e., those established in Curacao will rarely ask you anything). HOWEVER, after making this strange move they sent an email informing that they had adjusted their T&Cs and one of the new things was that they reserved the right to ask from you whatever the f they wanted, whenever they wanted (since they now urinated holy water, let me laugh).Few Months went by, nothing unusual, UNTIL... suddenly right before they had to pay me a little more than usd 800 back to my Visa, which by the way I had used many times there and in this particular opportunity would leave my expenditure with that card even (you may think of it as a refund) they froze the payment and requested from me over 10 documents, including screenshots and photos and the like of everything, plus proofs of earnings and/or savings, all of which I did send, since I am completely clean, but this was not enough for these holy inquisition team witch hunters and my money was kept frozen. Nice...So this is what I did:First, I informed myself thoroughly, finding out that this outrageously unethical behavior of them of requesting things just before they have to pay you back INSTEAD OF DOING SO BEFORE YOU DEPOSIT, had reached articles in newspapers such as The Guardian (go check), not to mention the huge amount of similar complaints about this rude and more than anything ungrateful behavior, all over the Internet.After having informed me I wrote them, and warned them that if they did not honor their debt within 3 working days, I would:1) Write to all the main newspapers in the UK2) Personally make a complaint at the UK consulate3) File a complaint at the Malta Gaming Authority (this one would have been a waste of time, but I would still do it)4) Write reviews everywhere (which is what I am doing right now)5) I would start legal action.I was paid within one hour.Needless to say, my account is at present frozen (for which I don't give a s**t, since I shall never, ever, put a single cent again).So, if after reading this you still go and gamble there, be prepared to out of the blue not be paid and to be humiliated by stupid, unreasonable, unjustified and outrageous requirements. THEY should send us customers all the proofs that they're clean.",1
2021-08-05,"As a gambler, the sports betting is second to none.All markets covered and easy to apply bets.But, when a bet is looking good and winning.It suddenly, for no apparent reason becomes suspended. So if you play for cash out. Don't bother.Also....the return on all.of their slots is truly disgusting.If you have a big win from sports, just withdraw.If you play their slots you will only lose.Did 3 grand in about 3 hours on slots out of a six grand win on sports betting. The slots are literally there to get as much of that money back from you as possible. Dodge at all costs. Much love.",1

They only have a recently played section which doesn't always load. When I do play I have had some pretty decent wins.  Withdrawal is straight in my bank. It is really quick. Blink and it's there.

I feel it's unfair n unsupportive n I feel utterly upset n let down ... trickedI feel my ignorance about particular modalities was used to take advantage of me£100.00 considering the current situation is a good lump of money n the only reason I played is that I was sure italy would win at penalties against England n get a good return n I naively played italy to win ... no matter howHad no idea of the extra clause n wasnt made aware of it by staff ...Contacted wh customer service n was gloriously dismissed...,1

No one on live chat helped..... they just read of a screen and couldn't care a less about me or my problem.

2021-07-11,Can I just say that after trying various bookmakers via several different apps I find William Hill to be the best. There has been occasions where settled bets haven’t gone my way and I’ve spoken to them via online chat and they’ve listened and understood my point of view and in some cases (where bets have settled unfairly) e.g. player being substituted shortly after betting on them to score the next goal they have sent me a £5 free bet to soften the blow. Add this to the fact I get regular daily free spins for various games (which actually DO payout) unlike other sites and I’m a very satisfied customer. There have been instances where I disagree with certain outcomes and as a regular gambler it’s nice to know your being heard even when you disagree with a decision made. I can say hands down William Hill are my go to App for all Casino and Sports betting and long may the good vibes continue.,5

2021-07-09,"The William Hill Deutschland Sportsbook site is appalling and German residents should think twice before using it. You can add a debit card to pay in but can then use neither the card you have just added nor your German PayPal account for withdrawals. None of this is made clear until it is too late. You are then left with only one choice for withdrawal, bank transfer, which takes 5-10 days. Their Vegas and Gaming links are still there and only when you click on them do you discover that they are unusable because WH no longer has a gaming license in DE. I also found their Live Chat extremely rude: I said nothing impolite to them, but they simply ended the chat while I was still trying to ask a question. I found the whole experience appalling and I will never use my William Hill Deutschland account again.",1

2021-07-01,"William Hill are a trusted brand who have a heritage in sports betting.  Their future is on Digital platforms and an engaging betting experience, William Hill need to up their game.The range of Live Games and slots expands on the sports book and they are good,  with a fair range of Offers and bonuses. Sometimes the Bonuses can be hard to decipher but refresh regularly.The sport book needs to be improved  e.g UK Races are listed but they are mixed up with Cartoon races which gives a cluttered effect for the serious Sports punter, Sometimes less is more.  Outages and downtime do happen e.g the Gibraltar fire with no Business continuity. Overall I would recommend William Hill but their CIO needs to step up.",3
2021-07-01,"The daily free 'drop' game advertised on TV gives the false impression that the game offers a 50/50 chance of winning a prize, as 3 of the 6 options are wins, and the other 3 no wins.In fact, its fixed. For 3 months I won almost every single day (I think I had maybe 3 losses maximum). My partner had the polar opposite - she lost every day.Since April, I've played daily and not won a single game of supposed chance.Basically your account is tagged either as a winner or a loser, the supposed random falling of the disc is pre determined.",2
2021-07-01,Best bookies I've found for odds and the withdrawals are pretty quick,5

2021-07-01,It’s ok you have just be patient with to wins,3
2021-07-01,The betting side of things is good especially the extra places at BOG & I would of given them 5 stars if the other games like the the slots etc were fair representation of possible wins as in many times you see the reels go to stop for a win then suddenly spin faster but I suppose if your playing with their money it going to be like that. It all entertainment for me & I definitely don’t expect to win big on slots or roulette etc it horses my main things as I’m in competition with a certain chance where as the other side of the business is really the carrot & donkey so it not worth thinking you have a real chance so treat it as just fun imo,4
2021-07-01,"Love the bonuses I have been given by William hill and free spins. The William hill app is amazing, will continue gambling with them very enjoyable.",5
2021-07-01,"Absoluteley awful company i have been a customer for years and yet get treated with contempt and i really doubt anyone has ever won a thousand pounds on the daily drop scam all i ever get is free spins then win nothing worth mentioning , this is a company which is comfortable in its position as one of the big 6 and really doesnt give a toss",1

2021-07-01,"Decent website, reasonable selection of free bets and odds boosts although a bit late with promotional emails, often arriving too late to use them!",4
2021-07-01,"William Hill is exciting every day with free spins (although could be a bit more generous  with 50p per spin instead of 10p or 20p). Also the free matched bets are really killing it, I can't wait to scratch every day. The one negative about William Hill is that they are very slow to update their odds on the horse racing section. I boost my odds at really bad odds and when the race has finished the boost is wasted because they pay at the odds that I should have got in the first place. William Hill  please improve on your odds and update more. Apart from that I have nothing but love for you. Keep up the good work.",4
2021-07-01,"Good odds and daily bonuses, along with the occasional free bets and matched bets.",4
2021-07-01,"William Hill has an intuitive, promotion-rich site with competetive odds.  I use them several times a week, online, on app, and sometimes in store, where I find the staff particularly welcoming and happy to help.",5

2021-07-01,I'm sure I've said before but William hill was my first online account... I guess I've tried maybe 6 or 7 different sites but none were as simple as william hill to use... So william hill is the only site I'll use now.,5
2021-07-01,Strudders888Well about 6 months ago William hill closed my account for no reason for which I was very angry as I’ve used their William hill shops for 30 yearsAnyhow out of the blue I got an email and they had reinstated my account and I must say ever since they have been first classReally good bonuses with scratch of the day and great bonuses with their casinoPlus speedy payouts and a nice app makes William hill one of the very best in my opinionThey could definitely improve their customer service though as I’ve found a few pretty rude to be honest but they get the job done,5
2021-07-01,Who offers more freebies daily they are scratch of the day bonus drop and free4all they are very good offers and I use them every day well done William Hill,5

2021-07-01,It's bit slow mobile app and would be nice to have more cash out options. Everything else is really good and have no problems at all.Withdraw takes about an hour to visa card odds sometimes can found better than other companies. So overall I would say really good company to place your betts or have few spins.,4
2021-07-01,"Lucky to get 1 star. The scratch and go never EVER wins anything. The bonus drop never EVER EVER wins. Hardly ever promotions to existing users. The games algorythms are programmed to suck money faster than a dyson hoover in a dust pile. Set fire to your money, it'll last longer.",1

2021-07-01,"Have used William hill for years online but this week after a series of small errors over the last few weeks with missing free bets etc the final straw came. I placed a build your bet for England Germany match. England to win , Sterling to score anytime and grealish to assist anytime. Thought I’d won at11/1 . Told everyone and then they voided bet and returned my stake after the match. I was told as grealish didn’t start match the bet was void . Had I of known this I’d of put bet on for other 2 picks. They choose not to pay and classed as void after match. Very disappointed. Il wait till my last bet is settled next week and that’s my finish with them .  Disgusting",1

2021-06-29,I have played on William hill for years But I have noticed only recently that if you have a 4 figure win they will do everything in there power to keep it in your account hopping you will gamble it back this is very unacceptable and should be stopped I believe this has come about since the law changed on reverse withdrawals As now they can’t reverse your money if you withdraw it it must be withdrawn,1

I went to a more professional company where they opened the account in 10 minutes. Absolute terrible service, I wouldn’t waste your time, or if you want to place a bet on the 2024 Euros I recommend starting the application process to open your account now and you maybe will get to bet on the finals",1

Since my old card already expired I tried to update or add new card to my WH account. System denied my attempts so I contacted customer service. Customer service aslede to verify my self again by semding id copy and proof of address.Cool no problem i thought.I sent exactly same picture I have sent to 5 or 6 other casinos i belong to  and added my b. statement.Normally everyone else doing this either automatically or max till end of next  working day. Oh, my how mistaken i was . I waited 24h nobody even send me any acknowledgement regarding my documents. Went back to customer service again  where swiftly I was told  to wait  a bit longer.....week later i logged in to see it something changed just to find out nothing was done. I went back customer service again  complained and after investigation i found out my id isnt good enough.... well  I laughed out loud, reallly? My eu government issued ID isn't good yeah? why? and when were u going to tell be about it? Who is now handling these proceses? Its complete disgrace  i wasnt even notified. No wonder WH is loosing its battle for customers.Disgusting, utterly disgusting.

Stop supporting these crooks and stop supporting this new WWE style scripted future they are selling us and our children.William Hill, Draft Kings, and every other casino or website work hand and hand with ESPN, NBA, and all major sporting events including vegas.

2021-06-20,This is terrible not a email nothing since. 26th April can’t  get through on a phone line or even live chat not responding. I made William Hill aware of this issue in 16th April then received an email 26th April suspending my account heard nothing since. After I done as the email read to contact live chat if needed help. I did the transactions details proof that they have been sent. 3 times went to the bank. They could not help as it’s a  closed account from 2018 .  June now William hills must have found them as it’s been 12 weeks ago that withdrawals £150 £80 were made 28th March 2021 .. this is when I was asked for identification as I wanted it put on my card not as a bank transfer . Strange as I have never used bank transfers . 1 hour 15 mins later I had to end chat as I had work . I left as it was went on the 8th April I won again withdrawals £450 and £50 went still on bank transfers. So left it waiting on these still nothing in the the TSB active account only bank I have. On the 16th April i went on to live chat I was told that they have been approved... I then ask them to give me the bank details which funds were sent. it was an account that I closed September 2018 Santander. This account wasn’t addressed here hadn’t been used 3 years. I feel those funds should never been sent as bank transfer didn’t match my address on the account. If I had tried to use my card it would have flagged that’s up with my account not addressed here. The fact that I was asked for identification that was approved. On that chat so that I could change withdrawals. over this has only been an issue with 4 withdrawals . Need to no why this has happened? live chat and whom ever approved my identification didn’t notice that the bank transfer account was different to the identification received? payments team were involved as I requested it be put on my card TSB would this not be the active bank transfer account ? This has to be an issue at there end. Identification sent not been checked?? If so they would have seen I hadn’t changed the address Santander account on the site due to me closing it in 2018 . I’m sure this should have went as a transfer to the active account used TSB ??? My closed Santander account told me they would have instantly bounce back as there isn’t an account for funds to be placed. They are putting it in writing so I can send it to William Hill. 12 weeks now it’s appalling the way I have been treated. I’m sure you can understand think there are faults with your system. I’m going get more advice on this for data protection that bank account Santander address should have matched my William Hill account. As my TSB bank is addressed here and William hills account both match. Think that’s in the gambling commission rules. For a big company it’s appalling ..,1

2021-06-16,"They are cheating for sure. I've spent days monitoring their virtual world - dog racings and even got a way to track every single win. Every single dog would loose max of 6 times in a row, above that number was win coming up very shortly.So I tested it and waited until one of the dogs lost 5-6 times then started betting, not a surprise suddenly my dogs (the one i'd bet for) would loose 25 timesI thought - ok, so lets say a dog can loose 10 times, so next couple of rounds, another dog lost 20 times. MIND that if I bet on dog number 1 - the other ones constantly win, loose max of 2-3 times, so then i change to the other dog and magically it looses 20 times while other ones constantly winFortunately!!!!!!!!! I only play with 10p so not a massive loss. I did win couple of times too, but this is early on when I login to the site, afterwards it immediately goes to my dog looses constantly, and the more you bet the more it loosesCoincidence? think notAvoid it at all costs",1

2021-06-15,I signed up more than a year ago with 20 pound and they never got back to me just took my money because  I didn’t have the correct documents because at the time I was living with my parents and didn’t pay any bills and have never been able to get into the account and the service just said… ‘sorry we cannot pass the second stage of the ‘kyc’ know your customer when I fully explained I love with no bills to pay so if you’re NEW to betting and young guy looking to gamble please avoid this site maybe Ladbrokes and bet365 better options I had with signing up,1
2021-06-15,"A verified customer for 10 years,  yet upon a very rare withdrawal, they request verification documents- which I have sent more than enough to prove my identity. Yet, through a shambles of customer service and 7 weeks on, I am left fraudulently denied my withdrawal. @WilliamHill #theoddsarestacked",1
2021-06-14,"£20 of free bets have gone missing out of my account, this is disgusting and is an error from the company of William Hill",1
2021-06-14,"AVOID. William hill is now into suspending accounts for no reason and with no explanation. Customer service is arrogant and completely unhelpful. They will ask you to email them a selfie of you, verify they have it and then keep asking you to send it again. Disgusting company. When I bet, I win like a man and lose like one. William Hill doesn’t. Beat em a few times, and expect your money to be held hostage while the payment team suspendeds your account and refuses to provide any answers. Ruined what had been a very enjoyable hobby for me. I won’t bet anymore after this is finally resolved. Go back to enjoying life",1
2021-06-13,Had an issue which was sorted out within 5 minutes after direct messaging @williamhill ..would highly recommend this bookmakers ....5 stars,5
2021-06-13,Excellent service on Twitter today! Resolved my issue in a few minutes.,5
2021-06-13,Hello I goy a quick reply re my rewards in my account Thanks,5
2021-06-13,"Tried to make an account as it had a new promo upon making an account, William hill management told me my account has been refused. I contact customer service and that's all I get. Waste of time and no clear answer.",1

2021-06-11,"A few years ago I joined William Hill and they were quite happy for me to place a bet for £10. But when I won this bet they then asked for proof of ID. I came across another customer that had had the same. To be fair they did cough up after I had produced documents but that said I had  complained profusely. I see there are many bad reviews on here and that William Hill are currently in court for stealing people's money. I also note that they are ignoring all allegations and poor reviews but responding very enthusiastically to any good reviews. I imagine this is quite a bad sign as they are probably just doing everything they can to keep their score up and the fact they have no response to any bad reviews speaks volumes. Are you just going to ignore this review William Hill? People who look on here won't ignore it, that's the problem.",2
2021-06-11,"If Gambling commissions main objective, is to prevent crime and protect the vulnerable as well as collaborate with police and government to prevent illegal activity.

2021-06-08,"there are dozens of online 'bookies' courting your cash .. i guess they all have their pro's & con's. For me, William Hill is my first choice and 'default' bookie. Excellent daily promotions 'scratch of the day' and 'Bonus drop' are 2 of the best I have encountered on any site; I don't think there is a day that goes bye without an excellent reward or offer. I also like the 'extra place' races, great for each-way backers like myself. Also, I like to use the 'pick your places' for some of the biggest fields. At the end of the day, they are a bookie out to profit but it must be said that they do give you a slightly better chance of coming out on top. Special mention to the guys who man the twitter 'help' account. Always quick to resolve any issue or enquiry.",4

Looked this morning email from WH stating that due to a technical issue 15 hours earlier they were taking back my winnings £57.50 and clawing back £56.30 would give back 20p stake REALLY THICK SCUM UMM £57.50 minus £56.30 equals 20p try £1.20 and these people are dealing with our money scary and oddly enough i didnt place a 20p bet in 4 hours of playing just apparently this game you buy boxes i actually had a £20 plus regular in this game as you also pay for extra boxes but unbelievable on this game in question 20p stake. So they stole back the winnings this morning to my disgust and when i question this my account has now been blocked/closed this only furthers my determination to get this money back i have spoke to their complaints dep as not a single phone line works told me takes around 8 wks i ll wait in the meantime save a fortune i would advise everyone who considers using WH seriously be aware they are corrupt thieves absolute arrogant SCUM who think i will let this drop couldnt be more wrong just think twice before you trust these with your money because at any stage and for a lot more money they can say a day later sorry but you didnt win if that is the case where is the reasurrance  in above board bets and honouring a legally binding bet at any time they can take your winnings all this from a multi mill pound company dont suppose they got this from treating loyal customers fairly and without contempt be prepaired to complain and get blocked done me a favour, take your money dont honour bets i wonder if i can use the same crap that there was a technical issue when i lost hundreds of pounds in betting doubt it one rule for one if they read reviews doubt it i will get my money back you may consider getting English speakers on your LIVE CHAT for what it is worth only spoke to 8 tonight couldnt help with the theft their bonuses are going to be fantastic this xmas OH WHAT A SCEPTIC I AM note they only reply to the 3 positive reviews must be busy in the complains DEP WH you only exist because of people like me lining your pockets get your head out of your backside and remember that maybe if you dont reply then we dont exist nice thought brace yourself your going to get another positive review in the next year or so so i will allow you to deal with that influx speak soon to thank you for the money refunded that you stole SCUM",1

That’s ridiculous lol. Bonuses don’t come and when they do it’s penny’s. Like I’ve probably played every game they have on there and they are all the same. Other websites I’ve actually hit the bonus and took £500 from a bonus, but not this company 😳😳.  I’ll be going back to my other sites where you can win money rather than penny’s lool.

2021-05-08,"William Hill, you gain money from customers so why don't you invest in your sh***ty app? I've said this before but it seems you greedy parasites don't want to listen to feedback.Doing a bet builder (like I've just tried to do) I placed 6 markets (yellow cards,corners, team to win) then add to bet slip. Why does it not place to bet slip when I've clearly tried to add to bet slip? It then goes back to the game you 1st wanted to bet on then you have to do the bet builder again. Your app is trash and if I could give you half a star I really would. 1 star is me being far too nice.Also your app is slow, always buffers, how ironic when it's about you ""not"" losing money. The app just needs dashing in the bin and starting over cos it's a pile is crap",1

I've got a much better record of wins/losses and I've really benefitted from free bets, offers and enhanced odds. Wish I'd gone ONLINE much sooner.

Having never previously applied to any organisation for such an account, I endured an extremely frustrating time trying to get a WH account open, then attempting to get the account operational, and, when that failed, making repeated attempts to get the account closed.WH seemed intent on making life as difficult as possible at every stage, with particular emphasis by ‘customer service’ advisors to provide unhelpful, misleading and often contradictory information.  Its procedures, communication and customer focus were very poor.When the account was finally opened, it was immediately suspended.  A ‘verification process’ was then started by WH, for which I initially provided proof of identity and address, and which WH then escalated with demands for source of funds, proof of income, and signed and dated photographs of me holding various documents.  I refused to go along with what I considered to be unreasonable requests being made by WH, and asked that the account be closed.WH ignored my repeated requests for account closure, and then, without any notice my logon details were no longer recognised by WH.  I took this to mean that the account had finally been closed.  I believe the reason why the account was eventually closed was because I mentioned in one of my many emails to WH that I had written to its UK General Manager requesting that he look into the way I had been treated by WH.Of course, there has been no reply to, or acknowledgement of, my letter to the General Manager, but the mention of it seemed to do the trick.",1

2021-04-27,"I've used William Hill for years and they have always been a trusted site for me.Unfortunately, they have really gone downhill in recent months. In April, they had IT issues which meant that deposits made on Google Chrome didn't reflect in the account. The hard part came in trying to contact William Hill to resolve the issue. When you try to contact their telephone support, you go through the Automated Call Routing system only to be told that no advisors are available due to the pandemic. Put this at the front of the ACR surely?Live chat is just as bad - they cut you off half of the time, or fail to resolve or even investigate your query. I have contacted them five times over the past three days and each time been told to submit all information including screenshots of banking apps.To date, I have had no feedback and the money has ""mysteriously vanished"" since it is not on my WH account, nor in my bank account and it appears that WH could not care less.Do not use this company - customer support is non existent should you run into any issues.",1

2021-04-26,"I attempted to deposit £20 but was told that the deposit was declined. After checking my bank there was more than enough to deposit. After changing from Vegas to casino I attempted to deposit again, this time no issue. When I checked my bank later that night I noticed that £60 had been taken from my bank that I hadn’t deposited, that wasn’t showing on my WH account. After talking to customer services they had said there was an issue on their end during the decline, and instead of refunding the money they proceeded to add the funds to my balance. Had I had issues with not knowing my limit, I could have spent that £60 as it was there. Very irresponsible for a company that has already received various fines from the gambling commission.",1
2021-04-26,See emm  I'm kinda shocked because these were my go to but men a few bad days with nothing but the blues changes a man. Well 2-3 or 400 on a roulette table and win nothing more than the stake you play lol so you constantly losing. Sports tick tick but that's my guess I believe they can't change that but also think the virtual is on an over all earnings so if that win on sports they pay out and if they lose the virtual claims it back!! You get what I'm saying yeah? Well I've seen lads win 7k and others lose the house they live in and more. What I'm saying is they are so unpredictable it's unfair. 70%pay out is I lose a pound I win 70p but we all know thats not the case as you can lose 1k but eventually you'll get 900 back and walk away. Tut tut not these you could lose 100k in 5 house and get nothing but homelessness and would they care? Not really your just another fool filling the pockets of a far useless *unt. Has he sold crack to feed his kids emm doubt it.,1

2021-04-22,Your money is not safe in your William Hill account. Their customer service team gave access to my account to an unauthorised random person. Who then has changed all the personal details on my account and then spent all the funds in my account. Attempting to get them to do anything about it is a joke and they are trying to ignore it ever happened. Customer service live chat agents are useless! The security team who I cannot get hold of because nobody knows their email address are shockingly bad. I’ve now given them a further 4 days to come back to me before I take things even further. If this was my bank account there would be action taken straight away by the bank. This lot are clueless! It’s a massive data breach of my personal money and data. It should be a priority rather than just trying to dismiss me as if nothing happened.,1

2021-04-13,"After reading most reviews I was very excited and optimistic to sign up for account with William Hill Sportsbook Colorado, as they were offering up to $2021 back if you lose your first bet. I downloaded the app and registered for an account, after doing so William Hill Sportsbook sent me an email fully verifying my information and identity. After making my initial deposit and placing my first bet, they suspended my account and sent me an email saying I needed to provide my full Social Security number ( this after sending them a copy of my drivers license, a utility bill and the last 4 digits of my social security number in the registration part of the process ) As most people are, I was very hesitant to email a copy of my Social Security card and or W-2 which is what they requested. After contacting online support and calling, I was just told that they needed additional information and not to worry about any other accounts but my own because I asked if all customers were asked to do the same. I have two separate issues, one is why they couldn’t give me a reason for why they needed my Social Security card and the other being why they accepted my deposit and let me place a bet and then deciding they needed more information to verify my identity? Please don’t believe everything you read about online Sportsbook promos. I’m  very disappointed because this was supposed to be a stress reliever.",1
2021-04-13,App seems okay in browser and betting was straightforward. I didn’t however receive my £10 free when first paying into my account as per an offer available at the time.

Can't believe all the people (bad losers) rating them down as they don't win money on slots (which is well known to everyone that they favour the bookies, it's common sense), I believe it's written in the terms and conditions the win ratio, you can't make it any easier. Also everyone complains that the company doesn't hand out free money. You don't walk into a high Street bookies and expect them to hand out cash at the door ""have a bet on us"". WilliamHill get five stars from me as they don't look after these money grabbing punters and look after the proper customers. Keep up the good work",5

2021-04-06,Overall I have had a good experience with William Hill. I bet on horse racing only. I like the three odds boosts they give out as these can significantly increase winnings (when I win!). The Money back if Second is a good offer too when it is available. I wonder why they make people wait until 10AM for B.O.G though. I used to get some offers through Scratch of the Day but not anymore which is disappointing as I bet regularly. I find their odds are usually better than Skybet who are the other online bookmaker I use. I never have any problems with depositing or withdrawing.,4
2021-04-06,"Whilst I’ve had no trouble with the site overall and whenever I’ve had to contact them it’s always been very responsive, far more responsive than some places. My gripe is with the bonus drop, I’ve done it everyday for around 3 months and I can count on 1 hand how many times I’ve won something. One time I won 1 spin! ONE! Compared to Ladbrokes and paddy power the chances of winning even once a week are VERY slim! I’ll not be placing another penny into my account until I see some improvements made to this feature.",2
2021-04-06,Avoid this bookie! Not a fair playing field at all had no problems depositing money when losing when the time come for me to win wouldn’t let me deposit    my own money to put 100 bet witch came in at 3 to1after spending 100s that day with this bookie trying to deposit 6 7 times would not let me deposit by the time bet is finished and won already it started to work again without fail while I go on to lose everything chasing what should have already been mine AND I don’t mind chasing loses but not what should have be mine already ended up losing everything. Definitely adds glitches on ur account when you are doing well too.  Not a to be trusted. Make what you want of this review but anyone who does well on this site will probably know this already.,1
2021-04-06,A truly dreadful bookmaker to deal with.Restricted my account without notice after a short while. Had shown a profit of around £700 mainly from Greyhound bets in USA soon all bets limited to £25 pay out ceiling. I closed account immediately.Worst horse racing BOG terms (after 10am).Overall look a complete joke if compared to most and especially bet 365.,1
2021-04-06,"Great easy to use website, been using Williamhill for over 8 years, great daily offers, and free gifts, obviously they tend to reward regular customers with the bonus drop, if you don't use the site regularly they are obviously not going to hand out free offers to you which is totally understandable, but I tend to win something maybe 5/6 times a week, but it's usually 10p-£10. The best odds guaranteed feature and the 3 daily bet boosts give you some pleasant surprises. Great customer support on the telephone, they have always looked after me if I have had a problem. Only down side is between 3-5pm on Saturdays and on grand national day the site tends to slow down a bit, but with the volume of users at that time it is understandable. Superb access to watch live horse racing and football games is brilliant with coverage all over the world. Can't comment on the Vegas and casino side as doesn't interest me. A really great company to use would recommend over several other betting sites",5
2021-04-05,"One of the very few casinos online that I can say I trust. I lost, I won, I've got bonuses from the drop, I always had my withrawals in my bank account in max 2 hours. I've been on this site for years and comparing with other casinos online I think they are one of the best.",5

2021-04-05,"I placed a bet on the Boat Race for the record time to be broken. I placed £100 on 2/4/21 at 9-1. After placing the bet, the odds changed to 6-1, and then 6-1 with a £43 cap. This was fine because I’d managed to get it at 9-1. On the morning of 3/4/21, they messaged me to say there had been an error on their side, but would honour the bet at 1-10 instead of my 9-1. This is what they sent:“We are writing to apologise for a display error that occurred on the William Hill website for the The Mens Boat Race - Race Winner event. The selection Record Time To Be Broken (16 Minutes 19 Seconds) (market #YourOdds) was inadvertently displayed as 9/1 and as such the price on your bet is incorrect.For a period of 09:50:00 01/04/21 - 09:50:00 03/04/21 we had Record Time To Be Broken (16 Minutes 19 Seconds) priced at 9/1. The price should have been captured at 1/10.We apologise for the error and any inconvenience caused. As I’m sure you’ll understand, we make every effort to maintain high levels of accuracy throughout the site at all times.In this case we will settle your selection at the best genuine price available in the market at the time your bet was placed. In this case that was 1/10.”This is a blatant lie because the odds changed a few times in the coming hours after I placed the bet.An absolute disgrace and very let down by William Hill.",1

2021-04-01,I will never use William Hill again cashed out a bet and then it didn't go onto my account balance. I am still waiting for this to be resolved after a lot of emails and a few months.,1
2021-04-01,William Hill offer great offers like scratch cards with free bets and boosts.  Their horse racing offering is also great; they are my favourite for this.,5

2021-04-01,"Always find they offer good prices and enjoy the free bets and the drop and scratch.Have a plus card but my nearest shop now is 20 miles away as they closed the ones in Portsmouth, So cannot now go to a shop to bet also sometimes have problems when betting on the App as it freezes so tend to use the Web page",4

2021-04-01,"Despite numerous updates over the years the app and desktop site continues to have slow page loading, lagginess in general, display incorrect in play odds/cash in values especially during peak betting times. William Hill regularly ask for reviews and i (along with many others I assume) tell them about their shortcomings, but this makes no difference. I'm highly tempted to try another bookie, shame because I've bet with Hill's for years.",2
2021-04-01,"Not been joined long but so far so good, I did use the shop to put the irish lottery on this app does do the irish lottery but I use to have 5 lines this app only gives you 5 number so that's disappointing.",4
2021-04-01,Rubbish I spend a lot hardly any profit made thinking of closing account they reel u in and kick u out,1
2021-04-01,Wouldn't even give it a star if I could they take away your free bets when you win and don't tell you untill 2 hours later but it's fine for then to take your money William hill are a bunch of scammers in legal form avoid using them there are better bookies out there than them,1
2021-04-01,"Ok I'm going to be honest after playing this for the last 12 years.Infinite blackjack,power blackjack and freebet blackjack are all FAKE BLACK JACK.  All you need to do is just watch.You've never seen a dealer win SO many hands from either 6 or 5's or the dealers first card is ten every time. It's 100% fake. Just watch if you don't believe. It's FAKE. Don't waste your money.",1

2021-04-01,"Your offers and rewards for loyalty are extremely poor, i have been a william hill customer for a number of years now and very rarely get anything decent back. Your free bets are given out to me very seldom and if you have any particular free event like bonus drop . 9 times out of 10 you give 5 free spins at 10p stake of which is just simply appalling as you will be lucky to win a £1 from them, i often ask myself why i dont join another betting firm and my answer at the moment is i dont really know as yet but if things fail to improve quickly i might just do that!!",2
2021-04-01,"Wouldn't use anyone else. I like to put a footy bet on and most of the time the odds on the bets I do with William Hill are the best. The games such as slots are really good aswell. The bonus drop could change up the games that you get to play when you win though, always seems to be the same one. Scratch of the day is really good too.",5

2021-04-01,"I aint no spring chicken pushing 50 so lived a bit of life. Love a football bet and have used different bookies along the way but I think William hill  late by far the best in the game for giveaways, ok they all give free spins here and there but at 10p a spin which ain't no good to no-one. William hill do them at 60p and 80p so gives a good chance at a reasonable win. They are now my first stop for a punt and I would recommend them all day long",5
2021-04-01,One of the best online bookies. Very user friendly app.,5
2021-04-01,"William hill is one of the bookies I really like betting with , they have a wide variety of market. They have really help me through out this pandemic period in terms of free bet and promotional offer",5

2021-04-01,"Absolutely utter appalling and nobody can say a word, talk the talk but should have license withdrawn as a betting company as had losing bets then backed a few dog winners and now restricted, the traders decision.

2021-04-01,i have been with several bookmakers and i have found william hill to be the best .if i have a query there is no waiting and sorted out straight away .i would recommend them,5
2021-04-01,Generally a good betting experience but I have been having issues with the Bonus drop free bets claim option. I have been on the live chat a few times but they are not very helpful and very rude. I have been cut off without the issue being resolved. Obviously they're not too concerned as its free !!??,3
2021-04-01,"I have held and still hold an account with Joe Ladbroke but I must say the William Hill website is by far the most organized and informative website that I have used. It is quick, accurate and a pleasure to use. Only one negative as far as I am concerned, I can get 700/1 on 6 ball Irish lotto but only 630/1 on WH. I class myself as an armchair punter, I am retired (Aged 68), have a knowledge of computers and love studying form, plus I have a very good memory, hence for my various combination forecasts and tricasts I tend to do quite well. Best I did was around 3 years ago having a 50p forecast combination and tricast combination on Aiden O'Brien (I always follow Aiden O'Brien in top races especially Grade 1's ) horses in last race at Royal Ascot (When crowds were allowed). As I recall the 50p forecasts and tricasts I picked up over £2k for an outlay of £6 (Not bad for an old bloke) haha. But no, a great site",5
2021-04-01,"Had a great experience with William Hill, great stakes and slots, really enjoyed it!!",5

2021-04-01,"I have no problems with WH, tough at the moment, cannot get to talk to cust services over any matter, they say go on line, ok for you youngsters, i can just about place a bet. The only complaint is that their BOG only starts after 10 am, absolutely stupid, also my maximum under BOG is £20. People are wiping their a--es with £20 notes these days",5

2021-04-01,Had a very good Cheltenham which was helped with quite a few free bets that i was given. I took some winnings out which were paid into my account in the time frame that was given. The odds at Cheltenham were slightly higher than the other company i use. All in all very good 😃,5
2021-04-01,I am pleased with your bonuses and help from your side I will say so william hill is the best,5
2021-04-01,"A good site with daily free offers.  Acca bets can be particularly good. offering either money back protection if one leg lets you down (on 5 or more picks) or enhanced odds (once every day).  The bonuses on longer odds accas can also be astounding, jumping by more than 100/1",5

2021-04-01,"Decent. Overall, I enjoy betting with WH. Plenty of promotions to keep you interested. Particularly like scratch and win and the boost option on Horse Racing. The app is slow and could do with improvement. Also get the odd bet limited for unkown reasons. The t&c's will say minimium £10 limit but somtimes I can only bet £2. BOG on Horse Racing is available from 10am, would prefer if this was earlier in the day and I tend to use betfair more often as a result of this.",3

2021-04-01,"Like the interface of the app, hence why I use, but customer service js not good. Also best price guaranteed is too late at 10am and I have to use other sites. Why can't you guarantee from say 7am? You are quick to apply rule 4 so what is your risk?",3

2021-03-31,"Everytime i look at the reviews on here it amazes me how many fake 5 star reviews there is, WHO put them on to try and keep their rating up otherwise they would be rock bottom in the ratings.Everyone knows that all they do is cheat people out of their money with rigged games and dubious promotions,Small firm trying to look big its time they were shut down.",1
2021-03-31,"Took a break from using William Hill, when I returned they gave me 4 different sets of free spins in a week, 2 month later and I've never seen a freebie since, no consistencies in these give aways makes it a let down for me, as well as the way they play on words, like ""over 2 goals"" instead of misleading just say ""3 or more goals"" I have been let down many times with this in different aspects but I see its a smart way to do word play to cover their own back even though you feel you're getting a good bet",3
2021-03-31,this is how it is william hill are miles better than ladbrokes for promos and free bets without a doubt!!!!! Only thing with hills no multiples on golf betting top players/nationality which is disappointing,5

2021-03-31,Great site with superb customer service. Only downside is their app. Since the recent update Vegas app doesn’t work and lots of slots don’t load on main WH app. Hopefully this will be fixed soon,4
2021-03-31,10% cashback promotion running from 26th until 28th.   Why do the promotion team release promotions tea time and not night before letting you know whats coming.    Instead off disregarding £100 deposited and staked before promo was even available to opt into (feel robbed),1

2021-03-31,"Poor, weak, sloppy customer service from William Hill. Closed my account for absolutely no reason at all, even though my sign-in details hadn't changed for a decade. As a result, all my ante-post bets vanished & couldn't be located. Even now, WH won't admit they made a catastrophic error.",1
2021-03-31,- promotions often have restrictions included in the small print that make the offer far less attractive than the banner headline.- if you opt in to promotions and leave without claiming the bonus it’s often awkward to reconnect.- some games open with a fairly high stake. If you don’t realise this or forget you can end up losing (say) £2 a game instead of (say) 20p.- number of times the blackjack dealers face down card is a face card or ace is uncanny.,1
2021-03-31,"Date of experience: March 31, 2021",1
2021-03-31,Only gave one star because there was no option for no stars. Don't touch promotions online as you'll never get your winnings. As soon as you win they ask you for age verification documents as photos. You can send them and they'll just keep asking for something else. It's an endless loop of deciet. Been trying now for 5 months.,1
2021-03-30,Been with William gill for 4 years now. This last year has been terrible. You need to put 5 grand in to win £1600 back. Such a shame as they are reliable with payouts but chance of winning is probably 1 in 30,1
2021-03-29,"The rt on the slots on William hill are terrible then again they must be on there ass to be closing over a 100 shops and trying to sell up so I imaging there trying to get the in take up high to lose to sell for more any way I was playing Bruce lee for over a week and Normally I don’t moan as gambling is never a win all the time but not one bonus or decent spin came in and as in decent spin I mean maybe 10 to 15 pound not hundreds so when contacting William hill they had told me the slot Bruce Lee had been removed from there website with on going issue with the slot so I waited for a reply as putting up with very rude costumer service and when I had the reply it said when I contacted William hill the slots was removed 10 minutes before contacting them,very strange how I mention it and then it gets removed when asking for proof I was ignored and told to have a good day and they shut the chat down let’s just say I’m on to the gambling commission I wouldn’t say it a bad site but these past few months it’s going right down hill be careful people",1
2021-03-29,Scam site every sites same scamming people out of money they need to be burned down !!!,1
2021-03-28,"25th May update: The Bonus Drop promotion is fab compared to the similar promotions in which greedy Paddy Power and Betfair offer*The service has improved on the website. Therefore I'm adjusting my score accordingly. Hopefully, I'll be back here to add another star in the not too distant future. William Hill offer a much better service than Ladbrokes, Coral and Betfred. Still a ways to go to be on a par with Paddy Power and Betfair, but they're going the right direction when other rivals are going in the wrong direction. I just placed a bet on the statistics of the Germany vs Romania football match. I was following the commentary on the website and it came up as Germany having a corner at around the 27th minute mark. Then all of a sudden commentary continued and the corner didn't count. So one moment I'm informed a corner has been awarded, and the next it hasn't? Make your minds up. You can't be giving out misinformation. Fortunately, my bet was only relatively small, but imagine having a very large bet on an outcome after your site has published incorrect information. That is genuinely cheating in my view.",4
2021-03-28,To suddenly charge me 22.20 when my original bet was 2.20 is one thing but your customer service is really the biscuit so rude it's crazy!!!,1
2021-03-28,Terrible I'm using a 300$ cell phone to bet on and iv only had bad experience s with this site from location of buttons . Mistakingly made 70$ bet I only wanted to withdraw my money. So after this it's been 3 days and I can't get 25 $ left in bonus activity.. Terrible customer service. Were after 3 days I can't get some one to put the $25 in my account .Very simple ASK. I'm very upset at this moment,1
2021-03-27,New customer and so far so good. Very impressed with their quick response and support via social media. Thanks for your guidance & support.,5
2021-03-25,Complained to the ICO due to data provacy concerns who subsequently proceeded with action for William Hill to contact me via an email to their Chief Executive. They stated contact must be made with 28 days. This has now well passed and no contact made so the ICO have stated that futher action will be takenReported again to ICO today to escalate. Hope these cowboys get fined.All of this from a complaint on allowing transactions to happen when they shouldn't have taken place. Refused a refund until i took this and and then changed their mind and offered refund. Not the point though it's the principle. Avoid at all costs. Don't let them get away with it and take action with the Gambling Commission and ICO if needed.,1
2021-03-25,Absolutely horrid customer service. There are way to many options for sports betting out there to use this company. Draft kings is so much more pleasant to deal with and have far more options for sports betting,1
2021-03-24,"I joined William hill last year. I deposited a total of £300 and lost I accept you can lose and am not complaining that I have lost. I try to deposit more money after losing when I was asked to provide identification and bank statement and a picture of my card... when I have looked into this matter I am of the understanding they should of asked for all of this before I deposited any money to there site to meet gambling regulations which they never obliged. Anyway I sent off my documents and kept being told my bank statement wasn’t acceptable there was no valid reason so I didn’t know what to do in order for them to accept it as I was told it wasn’t accepted but NEVER given a reason as of why. A month or so went by and I got another bank statement so I thought ok I’ll load this up see if this is accepted. I got the following email back from them....Nina Susette Cawan - 21/03/2021 08:15 PMHi Daniel,After a careful review of the documents you provided and your account activity, we have taken the decision to permanently close your account.Kind Regards,Account Assurance TeamWilliam Hill OnlineDaniel Wright - 21/03/2021 08:00 PMHi there I’ve just sent a bank statement dated from the last 3 months so don’t understand what you now need?That was my response again I got a response from William hill...Magnolia - 22/03/2021 06:37 PMHi Daniel, Hope this e-mail finds you well.

I find this behaviour from such a big company absolutely disgraceful and I’ve posted this on here for everyone to see it was slots I had played and wanted another go. Am also wanting William hill to see this and want them to know if they don’t do one of two things am going to report them to the gambling commission. One pay me back what I’ve deposited as they had no lawful permission to even allow me to make a deposit without asking for documents first or two re open my account. ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.",1
2021-03-24,"William Hill is scam-like.My friends convinced me to sign up for an account to take advantage of a risk-free bet they were offering.  After i signed up and placed a large bet, my account was immediately locked out.  after several ignored calls and messages, i finally received an email saying they needed to verify my identity.  after sending them photos of my license and a selfie, they unlocked my account removed the promotion.  Their reason for locking my account....my phone connected to a friends WiFi.  I don't understand what nefarious activities i could have been engaging in because I was on someone else's WiFi.",1
2021-03-24,"This is the worst casino you can find, they locked me out of my account for telling them that they are in the wrong. If you have the chocie of playing here with THEIR money. DONT DO IT!!!!!! Stay faaaar away from this s...t casino!!!!",1
2021-03-24,"So, reading the complaints on here, it tends to be a 50/50 split between ""rip off"" and ""poor service""- I have been gambling for many years and they are one of the most trusted sites- we all know that ""gambling"" is exactly that- we know the risks. What I am shocked about is the customer services, the phone line tells you to deal with the ""live chat""- the ""live chat"" tells you someone will e-mail you ""soon"". You get no reply ""soon"" so you go through the process again. And again. And again. And again. And again, you are getting the picture right? I have been locked out of my account since Saturday due to a ""technical glitch""- I have called, emailed, used ""live chat"" x40- yet nobody has got back to me. These live chat operators may as well not be there. They do not even read your replies, I am convinced that they are sitting there on an Xbox or playstation, just occasionally putting ""sorry to hear that"" or ""I understand""- I honestly think they just have 3 or 4 answers that they copy and paste to customers. This is a multi BILLION pound turnover company yet they cannot get the basics right. Shocking at best and if I could give zero stars I would!! Lets see if they even reply!!",1

2021-03-22,Absolutely terrible. As a paying customer I have been extremely patient. Waiting almost 2 months for William Hill to review my account. I have a balance of $2800 in my account.,1

2021-03-19,I can accept all negative reviews about any bookmakers but I don't accept any negative review about william hill. I play on william hill for more than seven years and I never see something wrong about it. This is the most serious company on this planet. This is the safest place to bet on. Your money is safe. Your winnings are safe. You can win every single day on casino and they never touch your balance. You can't find any fast withdraw as williamhill. The odds are very good and you can't find good cash out as williamhill. The live chat is the best in all this world.I have to say that when someone talk negatively about william hill then the problem is on him not on william hill.I'm not a uk customer I live in Morocco my username on williamhill is (chokwave) and I'm treated as well as uk customers. All my friends close their accounts on other bookmakers and open WH accounts as i advice them. They all thank me and they realize there is no such serious company as WH.,5
2021-03-19,The customer service is absolutely appalling. used their live chat a few times in the last week and it's like dealing with clowns. They must be chatting to numerous people at the same time as they seem to lack any memory of what has been previously discussed!,1
2021-03-19,"Would give no stars if I could.  Stopped using them when they deleted my bet bonuses by mistake, and didn't give a damn.  I told them I wanted nothing more from them at all, and withdrew my balance.  Still got emails, and unsubscribed every time.  No good; still get daily emails.  Contacted them and they assured me I would get no more emails.  Guess what!  Every day another email.  I am going to report them for this unacceptable way of ignoring their responsibilities",1

2021-03-19,"Would give zero stars if possible! I made a William Hill account for Cheltenham thinking they were a professional establishment and I was proven terribly wrong. Firstly, after placing one bet, I received an email saying they had reviewed my activity and were removing all my concessions meaning I could no longer bet or use my two free bets. I wasted a full hour on live chat with a customer assistant who was painfully unhelpful and rude, to be told they couldn’t give me an answer as to why this happened. Secondly, their verification process is absolutely ridiculous. They require selfies of you with your documents, once I sent these through I was told I then needed a second bank statement showing my money going into my Revolut account. And thirdly, their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. I emailed explaining my frustrations and received no response!! I emailed a second complaint and I was told they “didn’t see my last email” and that was it. So frustrated and disappointed and please, go with Ladbrokes, Paddy Power or Quinnbet if you want a good service. Appalling company!!!!",1
2021-03-18,"My go to betting company, seem like the most professional outfit. Quick payment! I was surprised when I saw the recent reviews but I am aware everyone has a different experience and no how frustrating it can be when they make it hard work (not william Hill). STAY away from Jumpman Gaming have many sites under different names.",5
2021-03-18,"I placed a bet before Christmas on a race at the Cheltenham Gold Cup- £20EW. The list of possible runners where there with the odds if you wanted too take them.

I'm taking this further....",1
2021-03-18,Absolute disgrace of a company I wouldn’t even rate 1 star if I was anyone stay clear all they do is take your money never pay out when you are playing the games they crash get stuck only ever does it when bonus starts to appear if your lucky to get a bonus pays out 1-2 pounds after doing well over 300 spins and that’s if your lucky it needs closing down robbing thieves,1

2021-03-16,More than happy to take my money but the moment I try to withdraw my winnings they froze my account and demanded documentation. Submitted requested documentation and they returned saying to do it again as it wasn't clear. There is no possible way to take a photo that makes the fine print of two pages of a financial document clear whilst also including my entire face. A quick search of online reviews shows that this is a very common issue with WH. God knows how much money they've fleeced from people with this tactic. A quick glance through these reviews will show their fake 5 star reviews and the fact that their customer service only replies to the 5 star ones. Abysmal service. Do yourself a favour and stay away!,1

2021-03-15,I put a $189 bet for the 76ers -1.5. In the 1rst quarter and they switched it to the second quarter. Complete fraud. They should have you sign a acknoldgement and email you immediately. This takes all posible fraud out of the bet. They stole $300 and something dollars from me. They make it so you can't prove what bet you put in. I turned them into Colorado gaming.I have never had a problem with any gaming sites. They commit complete fraud.,1
2021-03-15,"i have played many of the games in the Vegas and Casino sections of the websites over the years. Supposedly the games pay 94% to 97% on average of what you put in them but this is not my experience. Also there are many many problems with the website and games that really ruin the experience. One example in the last few weeks has been the balance on the account not updating properly as you play, it makes you think if they can't get this to work properly how can you trust the payouts. Its feels amateurish. Very disappointing.",1

2021-03-13,"Avoid using William Hill, they make up their own rules, and won't pay out when you win.",1
2021-03-13,Extremely slow verification process. It took 5 days to get account verified to make a withdrawal.Now the estimated time frame for the withdrawal is 5 to 10 working days. (so weekends not counted in this?) Are you for real William Hill? The process from winning and having the money in your bank account could therefore be closer to 1 month.On most casinos these verifications and withdrawals are almost instant.Also poor customer support on top of this and terrible live betting odds. (for example when match is in last minutes I noticed some odds were 3-5x lower than in most other sites) Also bonuses have very high wagering requirements and are generally way worse to those who aren't from UK. Stay away at all costs.,1
2021-03-12,Apps terrible refreshs or freezes so does the website . the arcade pin ball game is rigged ive had balls stop on the pin for 5 seconds to change direction into the X box. Don't stake with them you get absolutely nothing,1

2021-03-11,"Avoid William Hills slots like the plague!!I spent £300 plus in a week playing the same game ""book of dead"" now I've played this game on many other sites, Betvictor, betfair casumo etc. I know this game inside out  therefore know the averages & how often a 3 in row golden bonus comes along.During the week I played/monitored this game, I didn't hit one single bonus out of £300 plus, just the odd couple of pound here & they're from £1 stakes (a spin) this in line with the win average is not correct!!I know what the returns should of roughly been from playing it on all the other platforms, after losing £50 I knew I wasn't gonna hit a bonus but continued up to £300 (over a week) Knowing I was going to lose but carried on because I needed 100% confirmation that its clearly rigged & didn't mind losing the money to prove this because I can.🤷William Hill... You are thieves & Ive already taken the first steps to have your casino looked into 👍Go elsewhere people.",1
2021-03-11,"William Hill the bookmakers parade themselves as caring, supportive, and great at their job…. and so it is until it comes to settling bets.On 6/3/21 I was surprised at the returns I received on a bet I had placed that morning. I went to the chat room and spoke with an operator. This operator was most polite and followed my enquiry regarding the settlement of the bet. He came back a few minutes later and agreed that there have been a mistake and offered me £3.00 + some shillings. The shortfall, on my reckoning was more on the region of £30.00. I told him so and he went back to the settlers. In the end they had to agree with me that the returns were not correct AGAIN. This time they came back with a more realistic figure £67 + shillings for the full betThe settlers, not happy with that, next day 7/3/21 I found another bet where mistakes had been made. This time the shortfall was in the region £11.It made me wonder how many “punters” specially on the scale of lower stakes get cheated day in and the out, 1 shilling here, 1 shilling there…… makes you think.Apologies are great but trained staff that can settle with honesty appear to be scarcer. And could this be the tip off an iceberg? The wonder turns into worry.Place your bets and take your chance not only with the horses but with WHill and perhaps other bookmakers.All the above can be documented.Fernando Andres",2

Third : even if you get scater then a funny win ! Fourth: bonuses and free games gives only 1 free spin on any game! After only loosing on this cite I have the right to say that is a proper rip off.

2021-03-04,"I have played William hill over 10 years (regularly)the customers service is always on hand (live chat ect) and nine times out of ten they get your issue sorted before the chat has ended.The promotion they offer are great and the wagering is fair.I have just found this site (trustpilot)And thought I’d have a check out about William hill reviews and noticed most of the negativity is because of Identification ect.I get it as all you want to do is play and be able to withdraw ect but there is protocols for every site by law they have to stick to.as long as you send the right I’d there’s no problem you account will be activated again,I can generally say this is a trusted site I’ve never had a problem withdrawing money even when I’ve cashed out over £1000 from a free bonus 😁😉",5

AVOID AT ALL COSTS,1

However they’ve got the best prices for Cheltenham so I thought I’d try and get it back up and running. I’ve been onto their live chat 4 times in the past 24 hours. They advised me I need to send my ID which is fine I did that and then got an email saying my account was unlocked to try and log in and not be able to get in. Back onto live chat they assure me it’s unlocked which it isn’t. Onto live chat again they say the person ‘didn’t unlock it properly’ they finally unlock it, I get in and try to deposit money and now there’s ANOTHER issue and I’m locked out again. I message them on their help Twitter which is absolutely pointless and useless because they just tell you to go onto live chat which can take half an hour to get through to someone at times.

2021-03-04,I have not received a scratchcard offer for over a month now. I contacted the helpline and was told it was a game of chance a d they had no control of this. I had been receiving an offer everyday since I joined in December up till January this year. I spoke to a few friends who use this app and they have said that this has never happened to them. I have now come to the conclusion that this is not a game of chance and I have been frozen out for some reason.,1

Just lately the same problem occurred again and I contacted Hills but got little sense from them, so I gave up and opened an account with the tote itself.

My money has been STOLEN and I am asking anyone for assistance with this matter as the amount is sizeable to me.

2021-03-02,"Cut off twice by their live chat consultants, showed no interest in problem regarding a deposit made to play a bonus bet, just referred to the small print to say didn't qualify for a refund, as the qualifying price was flash odds and not official odds.

2021-03-02,"Lots of free spins, won lots of money from this (although bet it all back). Great odds.

2021-03-02,I've noticed recently that when I have tried to play a bet that it has not been put on because something happened and I was sent back to replace my bet . The way I see it if I play a bet 30 seconds before there is a corner then my bet should go through but there is no use trying to complain because by the timend you get help then it's to latell!,1

2021-03-02,I've noticed a big change in William hills slots ... Fishing frenzy megaways is daylight robbery.. I've been a William hill customer for quite a few years now and before the covid come about was pretty fair on payouts.. but for the past few months they haven't paid hardly anything.. I have been recording my game play as I noticed a big change... The slots would spin nearly identical when it was dead spinning this could go on for well over 200 spins and when they finally do drop the bonus it won't be anywhere near what you have span fair enough I do know it's luck based but 300 spins to get a bonus that some time doesn't drop anything at all .. I do believe all book makers should be investigated as there slots are misleading with there 92 percent win rate....what a joke... I won't ever be playing slots again I won't ever be depositing to William hill again they have lost a loyal customer,1

They will steal your money and restrict you so you leave the money and move on. Every interaction with someone via email or chat is all preemptive responses what a joke STAY AWAY SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE AND MONEY. Try somewhere else what a crap company no wonder their previous CEO got fired and the current Oke even worse,1
2021-02-24,A decent bookie I think. I like their money back       second and odds boost promotionsfof the horses. They do offer a fair amount of extra places for each way bets.

They will take your deposit and then freeze your account until you meet prohibitive ID verification demands in a transparent attempt to make you give up and leave William Hill with your deposit. Photo ID and proof of address is fair enough but they will demand to see your William Hill deposit on a bank statement, pictures of you holding the bank statement, a picture of you holding your William Hill account name on a piece of paper. The list goes on. These are beyond reasonable requests to keep customers safe and prevent fraud. These are the actions of a dishonest company intent on hoovering up the deposits of people who have given up on ever being able to access the money they deposited again. Why should we have to allow William Hill to snoop through our banking transactions for the privilege of being able to access our own money?",1

2021-02-18,"The promo code for superbowl sunday advertised a ""risk free"" bet up to $2021. I made a qualifying bet in the amount of $300 and the bet lost. I had to contact tech support via the chat function twice before the promotion was activated (i also emailed several times but never recieved a response). So now i have my ""risk free"" $300 bet. I make a bet and it wins, but guess what? Only the winnings show up in my account, and not return of the cost basis. Obviously, since it was the 2nd half of a ""risk free"" bet i wanted to ensure i won the bet so i took very short odds to ensure the win. As you can guess, without the return of the cost basis, the WINNING BET resulted in a substantial loss. I have never heard of any type of bet, whether a promotion or not, that did not include the return of the cost basis when the bet is won. Its a predatory promotion and a downright scam. I've been with FD for years and only tried WH because of the promotion. FD runs these types of promotions all the time and the cost basis is ALWAYS included in winnings if your bet wins. Because thats how bets work. WH is a joke. Take your money literally anywhere else.",1

I am very suspicious and am concerned someone may be passing on peoples details for fraudulent use. For the third time I have sent documents, two of them where I had to hold them and take selfies. I sent the requested bank statement showing the William Hill deposit as requested, but I covered my other transactions as they are private. They are now saying I have to send them all again and I have not to block anything out on my bank statement. It is just too much. I have asked for them to pay me my money and then close the account. I am awaiting a reply.UPDATE 5/03/21. I sent a complaint and heard back from their so called second opinion team on 1/3/21. I was persuaded by the advisor to send 2 more images, he said when they received them I would get access to my account. These were again rejected, I have sent a total of 14 images of my personal details  now and spoke to about 20 different advisors. They said someone would again contact me to deal with my complaint.

Well, I lost and they provided a free bet in the same amount, but it doesn't work and the WH site won't let me use it. If I had it available to me, I would have already won the wager twice.

I guess people only like to write a review when something bad happens so I thought I’d take the time and write about my good experience.,5
2021-02-08,Would give zero stars if possible. Set up account deposit funds and place bet to then have my account suspended. Send ID over including bank statement to then be told none of it is good enough. Why not ask for all documents up front before taking money? Or allowing me to place a bet. Customer service when trying to resolve is pathetic. Would definitely not recommend!,1

My ID, bank statements, my Paypal account, a photo of the app with my transaction, my username written out on a piece of paper. They then said it wasn’t sufficient and they needed me to be in the photos so I had to take them all again (selfie) with the same documents. They are still saying they want more and it’s not sufficient, asking me for bank statements from the last 3 months and more pictures of my ID (sent my ID over 3 times now) I have given up, they just will not send me the money I won.

2021-01-31,worst sports betting site ever. dont do the $500 promo. goto fanduel and do their promo. william hill is very misleading. i called before putting my $500 promotional money into a bet to make sure I interpreted the fine print correctly. put $500 to win 8 thinking I would get my $508. nope i only got $8. I called because nobody in their right mind would knowingly place that bet. there was nothing they would do for me. I understand that i misread the fine print but because I called to ensure I was making that bet correctly and they did not inform me I feel cheated. Had i known I would have made a different bet or never used william hill at all. shame on them for a misleading promotion. please dont fall for this scheme,1

For 6 weeks of repeatedly sending the same documents of me holding ID, bank statements etc they still refuse to give me the money. I dont even want the account now. Every email comes from a new customer service rep who has no idea. They ask for the same documents ive sent 10 times to then say the same thing after a couple days. The deposit was even made through Paypal and they refuse to refund it back to the paypal account also. My point being ok lock the account, but send the money back to where it came from. Pure stealers and must make millions off stealing peoples money by blocking the account and not re-opening even after every security check is legitimately passed. William hill Management need to step in, i have requested this several time, to which i get the same standard response of yet another new representative asking for the same things ive sent 10 times.

2021-01-21,"Issues with ViSA direct payment citing a technical issue, but the customer service agent tried to blame my bank, would not accept responsibility for the issue at all, despite there being a notice on the site saying there was a technical issue, I was simply trying to ascertain whether it would happen again because I had a right to know what was happening with my money. The complete moron didn’t even know there was an issue and then tries turning it around on me and blaming my end, that was never what was being debated. The fact she didn’t know there was a problem is incredible. How can you work in customer service for a company and know less than your customers, that is literally the status quo, they are so poorly trained and just work from scripts that never apply to any situation. They try to relate and empathise in the most condescending way given the context, you must wonder how these people got their jobs. The faster payments were the only decent thing they had, and now in typical William hill fashion they’ve ruined that too. I recommend Bet355 or Paddy’s, they actually reward loyalty and give at least weekly bonuses, Bet365 with no wagering requirements either. Also William hill restricted the races I could watch and there are no bonuses on accumulators or lucky 15s. Bet365 will also price match Hills so even if you did find a better price at Hills you could have it at Bet365 anyway. A company that has declined from being number one on the high street to a joke of a company that is in such decline right now they are trying to make money by cutting and taking more and more from the customer rather than recognising what can make a bookmakers successful in the modern era. They won’t last more than 5-10years, as that name that once meant something becomes worthless.",1

2021-01-14,"Awful site, odds and customer service! I recently joined the betting site, made my deposits and apart from the odds it was fine, they then sent me an email restricting my account and having to send relevant documentation to prove who I am. I don’t wish to do so and withdraw my money (not winnings) I spoke to a customer service representative and said my money is being held until I send the documents. I explained it’s not winnings and I want to close the account. They left the chat and that was that. If the documents are required why not request them before they take any money and place any bets! Joke! I will not use William Hill again! Don’t also be draw in by the best odds, you get the boost when you join but that boosts to odds that are on a par with Skybet for example. The mobile app also freezes and is not user friendly.",1
2021-01-14,"I don't normally write reviews but my experience with William Hill was so bad that I feel like I need to warn people about them.I signed up on their site and managed to put a bet. The following day when I went to check my account they blocked me without saying anything. I then have to chat to their customer service representative which then proceeded to ask for a photo with my face in it (a selfie) showing my drivers licence, proof of address and then a piece of paper with my username (handwritten). I complied thinking that it's just a standard KYC procedure. They then told me that they need a printed bank statement as a proof of address which is stupid as my address is already indicated in my drivers licence. Also, I told them that I don't get bank statements as I opted out for this service for environmental reason. I do everything online these days. I also don't have a printer at home even if I wanted to print my bank statement. They then told me that I won't be able to access my account without it.If these are the requirements to access the account, they should have been asked right at the beginning when you signed up for an account with them!As it stands, I cannot access the balance in my account. I've told the customer service representative that I need them to send the balance of my account to my bank but I'm not sure if that is even happening as they completely ignored that part of my message.I also asked them to close my account and delete my personal data with them and then they said that they cannot do that for anti-money laundering purposes. They will apparently keep your records for 7 years!!!!So all in all, I would avoid this company at all cost!!!!",1
2021-01-14,"Verification process is quite frankly a shambles. No verification needed to deposit, if your bet wins they make it as difficult as possible. Emailed them everything they asked for and they just came back requesting the exact thing i had sent them.",1
2021-01-10,Worst betting site ever. Always crashs 1/2 before games start and mysteriously works again 5 mins after.  And if you win a bet takes hours to pay so you have to transfer more money before next games start which they charge you a fee for.  STAY AWAY,1

Won some, lost some. I got emailed some good offers that were invite only because of my spending. Last few I got I claimed, deposited and spent thousands to not receive anything. I contacted the live chat and was told I'm not eligible for the offer I was discussing. I was the cut off and ignored. Took 3 days of emails and waiting on live chat to get a reply that reply was you are eligible for the bonus. Do I asked for it and I was blocked from chat and my account. I emailed again about 20 times until I finally received a reply that states I'm banned indefinitely with no way of withdrawal. So I deposited 430 pound for their offer. Didn't get the offer. And can't withdraw my money. Do not play here",1
2021-01-06,Awful company. Awful customer service. My wife deposited some money & within a few bets had the account frozen requiring verification. Funny how they didn’t need it before depositing?!All has been sent (which has been accepted previously no problem with Unibet Paddy Power Skybet) the bank statement they require has all things visible they ask for . Date. Name. Address. All 4 corners visible. ..She has covered the transactions as they are private & quite frankly none of their business...but apparently they have to see them!! Why???? As I’ve already stated this was fine with all the other companies. They are being purposely difficult & demanding something that is an invasion of privacy. For what end? They are like some corrupt bookie from 50s America,1
2021-01-05,"Started of good on William hill and had a few good wins. And then the volitility scales kick in and you win nothing. Recently the games have paid nothing at all and very few bonus rounds, then when you do get the bonus round it pays pennies. I had over 200 spins tonight and lost a fair amount just seeing if by random chance the bonus would drop which it didn’t. The app is terrible as well. Luckily I looked at my balance and withdrawals over the last month and I’m still over £400 up so I will not be playing anymore to give them chance to claw their money back it seems as though they let you win to entice you in and then will drain you for everything. Well not me I may of lost a lot over the last few days but overall I took more from them and won’t be giving them a chance to get it back. In my advice with the challenging times everyone is facing stay away from these sites and save your money iN the long run the house always wins and that’s what they rely on.",1
2021-01-05,Very happy 😊 with William hill i don't deposit big amounts but been so lucky on my wins got 320 then 300 and 250 on a bonus within a month its really helped me out.

They claim my money was deposited in my bank account.  I gave them my bank statement to show it was never deposited.  Now, they want another month's statement.  I have called a dozen times and every time I call, they tell me to expect a phone call back in 24-48 hours.  This has yet to happen.

2020-12-31,"I am not one to leave reviews. But I genuinely do not know what else to do with William Hill.I usually play Live roulette on various gaming sites. When I play I stake quite large amounts and the company normally asks for verification. The verification process normally consists of I.D, Statements, And maybe a utility bill. Normally you send this over and the company verify you with 24 hours sometimes even sooner.With William hill I deposited just under £10,000 on the 26th. I Collected £70,000 the same day. I was emailed saying well done for my win. Straight away the verification process took place. I was not fussed at this point and sent over every possible detail they could need. A driving licence, Passport, Gas bill, Phone bill, Picture of my card front and back. 4 days later and my account is still not verified. No money in my account. No phone call from william hill. They do not respond to emails, When you go onto the live chat. No one can help you. They just say be patient.So almost 5 days since I won. Still no money, Still not verified. Any other site you can be verified sometimes immediately. William Hill is by far the slowest company i have ever used in my life of gaming.I am starting to wonder what excuse they will give me about not paying me.To say I am upset is an understatement.I lay in bed and wonder when they will stumble across my £70000. I have lost total faith with them. Imagine if i lost? Would they need these documents to verify my loss?I think you know the answer to that.If you are a high rolling gambler and stake a lot. STAY WELL CLEAR OF WILLIAM HILL.",1

Selected cash out and it said processing. Waited and waited till the games were finished and unfortunatly the two teams didn’t score another goal . Have done cash out lots and had no problems. Usually when market changes due to goals or associated incidences during the match both cash out and betting is suspended . Customer care behind screens a shocker and being paid to do FUCKALL. Disputed them not paying me and they said there was no evidence according to their technical team . Asked for proof of my activities and what they offered in the last 5 minutes of the games . Got ZILCH response. So according to me Technical staff and Customer care staff don’t really have a scoobie . Just a warning to everyone if u ever experienced this or similar .

These casino should be illegal they destroy peoples lives while earning profits of over 250mil year with government getting there tax of around 100mil per year or more not including that 250mil that is all the casino to spread around there ceo and directors. Good luck with these but don't forget you will need photo i.d before withdrawing because unlike other sites that identify from bank account these are useless and only don't need to identify to take deposit but do need identify to withdraw,  if you not going to play fair Get lost.

2020-11-17,"William hill will be losing me as a customer today which is sad because I liked most of the odds I felt they were fair and I never had an issue getting paid when I did win. However I like to make big wagers. Like $1,500 per bet and you times that by 6 it starts to add up when your doing it 4 times a week. I don’t like carrying that much cash on me often and also don’t like to go inside and see a lot of people looking at me when I do put 10k on the counter. So for a year I have been trying to use my ACH and never will this company sight line let that happen. Its were not sure what’s going on, then it’s oh we need your ID. Ok well here you go. How long does it take to add to my account? Oh up to 2 hours. It’s been 48 hours and still nothing. I had this same issue 8 months ago and got tired of the waiting game and continued to make the long drive with all this cash but this was it. No longer will I do it until William hill starts to invest into a company that can handle a multi million dollar company like William hill. Sight line is hurting their perception and that’s all it takes for me. Ill try AmeriStar i hear the lines are a bit off from others but the customer service is spectacular. I’ll take that after this William hill run.",1

If you do win on bonus explorer which I admit I have once or twice, you'll get yourself (wait for it) a free spin, a single measly 10p or 20p free spin on machines that are known to gulp money.

There's no such thing as playing for fun and enjoyment when I never ever win and always end up skint. Apart from the forty pounds today before that I've lost way far to much and I ended up skint. I've never been one for any kind of winning luck. I've lost many hundreds over this year to slots and gained nothing back. To me William Hill slots aren't no fun playing. And if that's not bad enough I'm even having problems trying to sign up to become a member. So for now I've nothing good to say about William Hill except its the worst for playing slots in as I have found out and even trying to become a member. I've lost all and everything and gained absolutely nothing in William Hills. I know not everyone isn't a winner but I'm sure sick of your slots making me always a looser. I thought sometime some day my luck with the slots would come in. For many years it's proving playing slots to win isn't for me. If I have a gambling problem it's because I'm playing always on your slots to win. Chasing a mugs fools dream that hasn't ever came true for me.",1

2020-10-25,"This is my honest experience using William Hill. They entice you with very attractive promotional offers, having tried each and every offer. I have concluded that something is not right with the slots/gaming RTP, its almost as if theres a sneaky A.I put into the games to give you an extremely low edge. I was playing eyes of horus, big bad wolf amongst games. Must have had 40-50 spins on each without any significant winnings. Every time you make a profit, they'll send you more offers that just end up eating your money. I don't have this problem with Coral, Ladbrokes etc and the RTP of said bookies are acceptable. But William Hill, theres something really suspicious about their slots. How you justify giving a customer 50 dead spins. Don't tell us it's random, we're not stupid and something is going on behind the scenes. The ugly murky world of gambling, but I honestly can't say anything positive about William Hill.",1

Then when I change them to bets that are pretty unlikely it allows it to go through every time.  Customer service just says my WiFi is affecting my bets. What kind of BS is that.

2020-09-27,Just been to one of your shops in a busy part of Liverpool. Not one person in there. Had a little go on the FOTB £80  in not one winning spin. You actually wonder why no ones in there. Get a grip hills.,1
2020-09-26,"A few weeks ago, I was notified my account had been reviewed and closed from a sports betting perspective (They made sure to advise that I can still use the online casino of course). After following up several times what the reason was for the closure, I was advised that  they could not disclose the reason and their decision was final... I guess betting $100 per bet, and winning slightly over 3 years.. could make the sports book go out of business?  I'm shocked that William Hill being such a large company is handling their customers like this. I'm assuming that if they see anyone profiting they will close down your account.",1
2020-09-26,Don't do it. Save yourself the money and try a casino that actually pays something back. Awful awful bunch of dirt bags.,1
2020-09-26,"I've been a customer of William Hill for years and see myself as a loyal customer. However they are falling behind the competition and really just don't seem to want to change. For example this morning I wanted to ask them why I don't seem to ever be offered a cash out option on my accumulator and top scorer open bets. It took me four attempts to get through to their chat function after it timed out twice and I also had a girl answer (after 15 mins) then say straight away I'm in the wrong queue and she would add me to the Sports queue, but 10 mins later she disconnected me and I had to log back in. So after wasting around 90 minutes I finally got through. It seems that WH have the most complicated rules around which bets are applicable to cash out and which aren't. For example three of my four bets in my accumulator are top 2 finish, but because one of them is a top 3 this is excluded. Also my top goalscorer would be included if it was a win only but because it's an each way its not. I shared my frustration at how complicated this was and how restrictive it was compared to their competitors and was just told, this is how its been for years. As if that was a sensible and reasonable response. Unfortunately it seems WH are stuck in the ice age and don't appear interested in keeping up with their competitors or listening to the needs of the customers. Such a shame but for me it's time to close my account and go elsewhere.",2
2020-09-23,"I hav been with them for years and deposited alot, all of a sudden it excluded me from taking part in all promotions for no reason I contacted them and they said for reasons they can't say, but they have no problem taking deposits, absolutely pathetic site I have closed my account with them and joined sky Vegas and it's much better and fairer",1
2020-09-23,"I have been a member for a while now and I have been betting mainly on football games. After winning back in July August, my account was suspended. I contacted the customer service and they said that the account is under review and it should not take too long. A month later I contacted them again for an update and still the same. I informed them that i need my funds as I have expenses to cover. No movement. Another month gone and I am back asking for an update. Still the same the account its under review and they will come back to me when they will have an update. I have requested for the complaints process and the email to register a complaint as this is illegal to hold the funds for so long. While i was waiting for the advisor to find the complaints email and after  waiting for some time the advisor was only then willing to coordinate with the security team. How disgraceful, if that was that simple why not doing that the last 2 times i contacted them over the last 2 months???I am not sure if a registered complained would be of any use for any disputes in the future but it might be the option forward. If you feel like not giving out the money won, no problem but at least release the initial funds...some people might need them.",1

So not quite understanding how these things work I signed up and deposited £200 to my online account only to find the amazing offer that got me signed up had disappeared....so after having a quick go on the fruit machines I came to my senses and requested a withdrawal of my money, what happened is that after 3weeks I still hadn’t received anything so contacted customer service only to be told numerous times I’d have to provide them Id drivers licence, copies of bills with address on and even details of my Apple Pay account...even thou this was an unreasonable request on their part and completely against the rules and terms of the license issued by the gambling commission they kept this up for weeks till I had to escalate the problem to 2nd opinion customer service personal...it has taken me over 8weeks of messaging and arguing with these people with the threat of using the resolver service to get my money back off them, and even then they just dumped my money back in my bank without so much as where sorry here’s your money back email or message.So my advice would be stay well clear.",1

2020-08-31,William Hill new roulette is nowhere near as good. The old roulette table was excellent and one of the best out there. Why they have changed it is so terribly disappointing.

2020-08-30,"I've been a customer of William Hill and use them for horse racing bets of £100 upwards. Why oh why have they changed the betslip? It just doesn't work! If the odds change, it is is now too easy to accidentally place the bet without confirming the new odds. Yesterday I thought I was placing a £200 bet at 4.33 and it got taken at 4.0 because the odds changed just as I pressed the button.Most other sites you must confirm any odds changes before placing the bet (as it should be)As far as I'm concerned William Hill are ripping off their customers with their 'new improved betslip' and I'll be moving over to SkyBet until they fix it!!",1

I sent my passport ID, to my surprise to be able to withdraw my money, coz in this stage all I wanted was closing my account, then he has asked for photo verification, like the ones you take holding docs, for some KYC... before I was able to give that picture he told me that thy`re team accepted my passport as ID, exactly when I sent my pict holding a personal ID.He could not even answer when I should get my money back in my e-wallet.I really do not understand, why this guys makes so difficult the customers life, but I deeply understandwhy they have so poor review, I`d say, this rate is way more then they deserves.They are not even good in terms of odds, I wonder how to they are still a live?",1

That is theoretically impossible and again, they’re not even subtle about their obviously fixing / cheating to gain their own advantage. Stay away. Don't get me started on the reports of changing bet rules during the game like new min or max bet allowance... how is that even legal?

2020-07-16,So after having a WILLIAM HILL account I woken up this morning to an email saying my account was suspended permanently.. so I sent an email looking for an explanation and got no where. I did have some nice wins last week on sports betting and cashed them all out so maybe that’s the reason oh well lost a very loyal customer and I won’t be going near any there shops either.. 1 star is too kind no stars for these MORONS..,1
2020-07-16,Do not use William Hill I have been a customer for 6years not had a problem then woke up this morning to state that they have deactivated my account for good with a 300pound balance on it... Live chatted William Hill for there reason why they done that the cheek on it could not give me a explanation they said my account money is not refundable wow never heard such a thing... Having to now get ombudsman onto it disgusting... Read in forums and it's not the 1st time they have done this to customers,1
2020-07-16,"Site is FIXED! There are patterns all over the place. This site DOESN'T DEAL RANDOM CARDS! Pattern: 1) 8/10 the person with the higher stack will win, 2) Most wins are won by BIG hands, 3) The game will trap you! - You may be dealt with ""AA"" BUT the HIGHER CHIP LEADER (who ever that is?) 8/10 you will loose. DO NOT PLAY!!! THE GAMING COMMISSION SHOULD GET INVOLVED AND INVESTIGATE. There is PLENTY of EVIDENCE of repeated patterns that DO NOT take place in a legitimate and/or fair game. WILLIAM HILL POKER is such a CONN!!! You have been WARNED!",1
2020-07-12,Has anyone else been told theyll get their withdrawal winnings within 4 hours? I've been told this 3 times now that my accounts have Visa direct fast payments but ive never received my winnings without waiting 2 to 3 days. Does this 4 hour thing even exist?,2

2020-07-10,"Thought I'd leave a good review as all I keep seeing is bad ones. I've been with william hill for about 2 years now and not had any problems at all the first time I joined william hill I won around £1000 in all in the first few weeks which I thought was just beginners luck, took a little break came back won £400 came back again won £700 came back again won another £400 took another little break which took me up to last week put £20 in and withdrew £300. I've always won here and there with william hill obv I've lost some aswell which is part of gambling but I've won more than I've lost. I love the william site more than many others virgin games got the chop last week coz there crap ha. Thanks william hill 😊",5
2020-07-09,"Must  clear up something I made a comment on I use my local William hill shop tong street Bradford I did say that at the time certain members of staff namely Pauline could turn milk sour by looking at it. Had nothing nice at all to say, I must say at the shop on Tong street Bradford is an amazing place smiling staff talkative helpful in every way. Lovely people must shout Two people out who work in this shop Sarah most helpful lib how she operates within the shop & Matty pleasant helpfully with anything you ask Two people a credit to William hill this shop is a pleasure to go in now thanks to good staff I hope this clears up any misunderstanding I may have given the Tong street shop in Bradford.",4
2020-07-08,After hours of verification they restricted me to 0.00 max bet for NO REASONif u dont want to waste hours just register to another bookie,1
2020-07-08,Didn’t get my winnings twice no matter how hard I try can’t talk to anyone do not give them your money unless you want to be robbed avoid avoid avoid!,1
2020-07-05,"First deposit of £20, few spins, £230 withdrawal.",5
2020-07-05,"Like others I'd give 0 if possible....through boredom, just played a 10p Megaways slots (Fishin Frenzy), to see how long to get a bonus.............after nearly 500 spins and no bonus feature, gave up but im sure thats a reasonably fair amount (sighs), at one point on autoplay went 45 spins without a single penny win!!  I thought it was just freak days when it did similar twice in last 8 days on same game, now I know there's clearly more to it...espec as I've also played same slot on Coral,Skybet,Betfair & Ladbrokes recently and you dont even go 100 without hitting it on theirs. Also WH payouts if you ever hit the bonus are about 70-80% less than the other sites, quite often they've been less than £5 where the others are usually £15-20 average, yet i was under the impression there was supposed to be no operator interference on these things",1
2020-07-04,William Hill are by far the worst bookmaker for Horse Racing Odds - Check ODDSCHECKER and you will see what I mean. If you bet with these crooks you will lose. On the rare time they are best odds (more chance of being hit by lightning) they won't take a bet of more than a £5 often they only offer to take pennies,1
2020-07-04,After 3 years of just taking money off them by only using promos . Total over 5000 pounds took off them and they finally twigged on by suspending my account this week.  if I can make this money so can you. I've opened a new account in my relatives name now with new sim card and their bank details (permission given lol) and will start making money again off them lol. You should do the same so easy.,1
2020-07-03,I played the Bonus Explorer from the promo section for more than a month and I never won a free spin. How can be possible?,2
2020-07-03,I am on gamstop and have been able to deposit £1520 in around and hour... I have won 3k- now I am waiting on chat to get docs sent over and everythingelse- if they do not pay me I will be contacting the gambling commision,1
2020-07-02,Avoid at all costs. Worst customer service EVER. you are treated like crap. The customer services are thick and havent a clue. Took 4 goes to validate docs. They just jerk you off.,1
2020-06-30,"signed up deposited and played for a few weeks, then i became furloughed so took a small break, when i came back i was told i had an existing self exclusion from a different account, which i accept, i did not know it was still in place i thought the account had been deleted... but i know i did have one previously. i signed up with all my correct details, passed the verification and played away quite happily. what has annoyed me is that if i had withdrawn cash would they have paid out? they allowed me to play whilst self excluded and as far as i am aware that is illegal. so i will be taking this further as they are clearly not abiding by the law.",1

2020-06-27,"The Moscow Liga Pro odds come out very late, other bookies have them straight after midnight. Apart from that  it's ok but slow on a tablet.",3
2020-06-27,"William hill’s new “Bonus Explorer”, absolutely RUBBISH! The most you ever win, and that’s rare, is “1 free spin” on a fruit machine. How they believe that this would be attractive to their loyal customers beats me! I didn’t even want to mark it with 1 out of 5 stars but couldn’t write this review without clicking at least 1 star..",1
